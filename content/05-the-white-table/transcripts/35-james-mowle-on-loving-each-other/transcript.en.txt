Text: 1. John 4:7-21

We know many brands in our everyday life, which are easily recognizable by their logos.

We also like Christians should live our lives in a way where people can easily recognize that God is working in us.

Jesus gives us a new command: love each other.

“New” in the original Greek means “an unusual” command.
Jesus fulfilled the law. He then gave us our “trademark” that would be easily recognizable to others - our love to one another.
Jesus could have said “you will be known by your knowledge, great people in church…” but he chooses love.
In the garden of Eden we see a picture of relationship between God and people, and people with each other before sin. After sin these relationships were damaged.

Jesus restored these relationships. With Jesus it is possible to love one another again.
This is a love that is a serving and sacrificial love.
Jesus said that before after washing His disciple’s feet and before going to the cross.
Only with Jesus is it possible to love one another, we as people on our own can’t do it. 
This is the core value of the Church. Church can’t be just something you attend - you need to get involved in community.
Let humility define our lives. It will transform our relationships. It allows us to be gracious to others and assume responsability for our own behaviour.

1. Peter 5:5

"Who is Your Daddy?"

Romans 8-14-15 NLT
We need to live in confidence that God is totally protective to us. He is our Daddy who cares about us. We can live a spirit-filled life because of Him. The term Father is quite distanced, the term Daddy is always approachable and affectionate. If we know God in a Daddy sense it will do a lot to our Christian life. This is something that people will be drawn to. 
Luke 15:20-24 NLT: It’s the story of the prodigal son and more importan the story of a loving Daddy. Jesus is basically saying that this prodigal son is fallen from the highest place to the lowest. But the father takes him back with open arms, he sees him while he is still a long way off. This father is actually looking for his son every day and when he finally comes home he is running towards his son. In this culture a man of authority would never run, but this father does. God humbled himself in the same way like the father is running towards the son!
God gives us authority in the same way the father gives the son a ring.
God gives us freedom like the father gives shoes to the son.
God clothes the son in a robe, we know it is the robe of righteousness. 
God is a loving father that we can have a relationship with. Through Jesus Christ we can come boldly to out father. 
The oldest son is the one who is angry, because he doesn’t understand the love he only sees the logic. The fathers answer is that celebrating the lost one coming home is a great reason to celebrate!
