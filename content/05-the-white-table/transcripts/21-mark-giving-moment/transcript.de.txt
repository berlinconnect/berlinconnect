Text: Deuteronomy  28:2-3 ESV

Is your example worth following?
What are you doing to move your life forward?

**the bowl:** 
your daily life, your home & family. A blessing of hospitality, where you have enough for you, your family and others.

**the basket:** 
A blessing for your work and where you are sowing your life into. For example, if you are a teacher he wants to bless your profession.

**the barrel:** 
This speaks of fun and loving life. God wants to bless your life so you can love life. 

**the barns:** 
This is about the bigger investments and assets, the properties and businesses you own. God wants to bless it so you have something for your children and something for your children’s children. Start building a barn!

There is no part-time relationship with Jesus.

**MESSAGE:**

Jesus said He would build His Church.
If this is what Jesus is about, what should we be about?
If Jesus is building his Church, his Church should be building the Church.

What kind of Church do we want to build?
It’s not about what you do but what you are a part of.

1 Samuel 29
We have the choice to live our lives with instruction or initiative.

Do we just take instruction?
During preparation there is a lot of instruction.
On the moment the team is playing in the field we need a whole lot of initiative.

If we are taking new ground by building the Church we shouldn’t be afraid of change and innovation.
You can serve God in whatever you are doing.

Some are still waiting for instruction and it’s time to take initiative.
God is a God of initiative.
Instruction can take you to initative.
If you are just waiting for the next instruction, it reveals where your heart is.

You don’t need to be told to take a friend to Church, baptise someone, create an atmosphere of faith! What you need for that is a heart-connection.
If the heart is connected to God you will take initiative.
Love always flourished around initative.
