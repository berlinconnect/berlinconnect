Text: God had set Moses apart to free the Jews from slavery in Egypt and into the promised land. When they had crossed the red sea and arrived in a place called Mara, the people started complaining to Moses, because the only water there was bitter. But God told Moses to strike the rock with his rod, so fresh water came out. And Mose did as God told him.
 
38 years later, they came to another place without fresh water so the people started complaining to Moses again and asked him why he even led them out of Egypt. This time, God told Moses to speak to the rock at that place so that water would come out. Moses, because he was angry at the people for complaining so much, struck the rock instead of speaking to it.
 
In the same way, these two passages symbolise two types of Christ: 1) Jesus is the rock in the picture that was struck and hung on a cross. To get saved, you need the cross. 2) The second time, the speaking to the rock symbolises the resurrection. So, after being saved you need to speak things into life and existence. You don’t need to turn around again, but speak things into existence out of your relationship with Christ. There is power in your words.
 
Proverbs 18:21 - There is power of life in death in your tongue. So be careful what you say.
 
Proverbs 6:2 - Our words can trap us and determine our path, if we speak negative things over our lives; our words can keep us from moving on
 
Proverbs 4:23; Matthew 15:18 - Be careful what you allow to drop into your heart. Don't speak about negative things that affect you like they are part of you. 
 
The bible shows us two different ways of approaching negative circumstances:
 
Job  3:25 - "What if fear has come upon me" > speaking negativity and fear over himself
David, Psalm 23:6 - I am still blessed despite my circumstances > speaking life and blessing
 
Boldly confess God's word; if you read a verse that speaks into your situation, take ownership and apply it to your situation; speak it over your life because there is miraculous power in it; USE the words that God has given you in the bible for your situation. We will never get to know God if we don't take the time to pray and to read the bible.
 
Romans 8: there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ; let the weak say "I am strong"
Philippians 4:13: God will supply ALL of your needs
 
If you want to change the world, you must change your words; speak words of life to those around you like their lives depend on them for nourishment, because they do; your word molds and influences the future of everyone around you
 
Proverbs 15:4: Your words are like a tree of life
 
Acts 2, 1-4: the first thing Jesus did after he died and rose again was that He CHANGED TONGUES through the holy spirit
