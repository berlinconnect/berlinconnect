Text: What name do you turn to when things go wrong in your life to listen and to help? What persons or things do you turn to in these situations? Is it relatives, friends or food or other objects? There is power in forming a habit of speaking the name of Jesus over the things in your life.
 
Acts 4:8-12: The disciples healed people in the name of Jesus and with His authority. There is salvation in no other name.
 
There are 200 names in the bible that describe God's character - studying them reveals His character.

His name means “You are saved”
 
Romans 10, 9: There is power in reminding yourself daily that you are saved. You have not been saved to wait for your death and then enjoy reunion with God but you are saved daily from imminent danger. Your past does not determine your future any more. 

His name means that “you are healed and made whole”

You are being made whole - work out your salvation daily.
 
Isaiah 53:5 He was beaten for our healing. If you are saved, you are healed. Walk in the healing. If you believe in your salvation, you also have to believe in your healing.
 
His name means “Emmanuel - God with us”.

Matthew 1:23: The name Emmanuel means “God with us”. He is not distant, he is in our neighborhood.
 
Hebrews 13,5: Jesus is with you
 
Isaiah 43, 1-2: God is with you and you will prevail
 
If God is with you, then he is interested in all the little things in your life just as much as in the big and important things. He is personal and wants a permanent conversation with you. How do you handle intimacy with God? Can you see him as a father, as a brother, as a lover?
 
His name means “He cares about you”.
 
Genesis 16:13: You are the God who sees me and who really understands everything you are going through
 
Hebrews 4:13: Nothing exists that is hidden from God
 
Psalm 139, 7-10: You cannot go away from His presence
 
Philippians 4:19: He will meet all of your needs
 
Revelation 21:6-7: He is sovereign over every single moment from the beginning to the end
