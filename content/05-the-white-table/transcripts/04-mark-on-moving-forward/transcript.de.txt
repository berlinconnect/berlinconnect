Text: We **receive** on our own table
We **are blessed** on our own table
But we are called **to bless** the table of others!

He wants you to bring life, to talk to people that you’ve never thought you will be talking to! 
He wants to use you to bring life!!

It is important to be planted in the right church. There isn’t a better time to serve Jesus.
 
Jesus will never remind you of your past. He is the lover of your soul and will remind you of your God-given future.
 
If you speak to people’s behavior, you do not give people answers to move forward. If you speak to someone’s potential, you are giving them a chance to rise.
 
If you let God work in your life, he will put you in places you’ve never been.  We are called as a church to take new ground. We are in the pioneering season. We are moving forward – taking ground that has not been taken and reclaiming ground that has been lost. The joy about building the church is building peoples lives.

Lets be **AUTHENTIC**! 
People might not like the walk & the talk but authenticity is attractive, you can’t deny it!!

Let’s be **ADAPTABLE**!
Adaptability is a gift!
 

Let’s treat sundays as **the first day of the week**!!! Because it is the first day of the week, God doesn’t want & get our leftovers. Sunday is the first day of a brand new week. Business gets the second day – monday!


 
**5 things that will keep you back / to make you move forward in your life:**
 
1. Entitlement (= “I am entitled to do / have this!..” proud and self-centered – I am the most important / Hedonism / it points the finger at everything outside, but never in the inside!)
2. Self-focus 
3. Independence
4. Mediocrity
5. Smallness
             	
OPPOSITE TO:
 
**5 things that will define your life and help you move forward /make you prosper:**
 
1. Servanthood
2. The cause of Christ (= our message is the greatest!)
3. Submission
4. Excellence
5. Generosity (= not just giving, but the way you think / speak as well!)
 
All of these good things were reflected in Christ!! The only person that was excellent in all of these things!
Jesus WAS THE GOOD SAMARITAN!!!
