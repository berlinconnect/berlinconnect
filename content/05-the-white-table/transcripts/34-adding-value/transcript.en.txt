Text: Overflow is always connected to God. It’s not so much about what you do, it’s about who you are connected to. 

The old Testament story of Joseph in Genesis 39:1-23 is about bad things happening to a good man. One of the key things in Joseph’s life was that he really kept the spirit of servanthood. He was a slave and had to serve without any preferences.

We all have the capacity to dream bigger and live bigger lives. There is more to you than others see.

The Psalm 23 kind of life is a life which is filled with God’s promise and overflow.

You never know how much is inside of you until you have to face pressure and adversity. 

We always have a choice to serve: let’s take on the position of a servant wherever we are. We should be adding value wherever we are. 
Situations should be better because you were there and added value to it. Our world is looking for people who add value in any kind of area. 

Despite the difficulties Joseph always dreamed a dream. He always knew that God was with him and he had a strong relationship with Him. Kids start of life with having dreams and it’s only later when they start to loose this ability. Why don’t we try to have childlike faith in our God and start dreaming again?

Coming to Church the only way you can come is “come as you are”. But when the grace of God is changing us it’s all about the commitment in our heart. We are not just called to survive. People who have experienced overflow will be non-complicated and add value. 

You need to focus on Christ in order to be able to add value to other people’s lives. The more you live from Him the more you are able to let go of your own shortcomings and rise above. 

Time will always reveal the quality of our decisions. In the same way after all the struggles Joseph eventually becomes the most senior person at his time. This simply means: God will get you where he needs you to be if you just commit to godly character! Let’s be confident people, because confidence is a builder. When you are surrounded by truly confident people they will lift you and bring out the best in you. We need to be a generation that is not giving up, that is raising above circumstances. Over-nurtured children can’t handle adversity. Joseph was not over-nurtured, he was familiar with difficulties. Can you handle pressure? Pressure is revealing what’s inside of you. Joseph was a man of character - this was revealed when things didn’t go well. He kept adding value. Let’s add value to friendships, relationships, businesses -  adding value is not subjective, it’s who you are. Do you see yourself valued? Because of what Jesus did for us we are valued! Jesus puts value on each and everyone of us.
