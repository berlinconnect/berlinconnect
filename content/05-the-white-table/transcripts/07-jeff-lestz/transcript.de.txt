Text: In Hebrew the word love means
- loyalty
- commitment
- covenant

Don’t judge where you’re going by where you came from.
Don’t allow your history to be your destiny

God is a God of principle.
If you are faithful over little He will make you take care of much.
When God blesses you can you still operate in covenant and principle?
When you come into covenant with God and you remember that it is God that has given you to it, you will give cheerfully.
Is money important?
Finance is something that affects us today.
How you act with money is probably how you act with the rest of your life.
 
Luke 16
Jesus said if you can’t be faithful with finance, who will commit to you the true riches of heaven.
We need to learn how to be faithful in the little, so that God can bless us even more.
We all think about 4 areas in our lives in a daily basis: Relationships, Financial, Health, Spiritual.
To have great relationships: Jesus said let the biggest amongst you be the one who serves.
 
Deuteronomy 6:4-5
“With all my strength” – strength here in Hebrew means: possessions and money
 
There is no shame in being in poverty, but don’t stay there.
If you want to help the poor, don’t be one of them.
If it is more blessed to give than to receive, so how will you give if you don’t have anything?
 
Money is not a bad thing.
Money makes good people better and bad people worse.

When you put God in the middle of your life, God is obligated to take care of you because you are in covenant.
 
Deuteronomy 8:10
With God at the centre of your life all things are possible.
 
How any one can have prosperity in their lives and what sets them apart
- Taking care of Gods house first means your house will flourish.
- Whenever we obey God.
- If you pray like everything depends on God but work like everything depends on you, God will add his super to your natural.
- When you prosper in your life you begin to be able to minister to other people.

Genesis 25:5

Anything that you exalt above God becomes idol worship

Talent will get you to the top but its your character that will keep you there.

Whenever you put God first in your finances, He is bound to give you the root not the fruit. When you get the root, you get the fruit also.
