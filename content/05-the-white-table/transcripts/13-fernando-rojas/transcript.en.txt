Text: We need rocks as a foundation so we can withstand the storms of life.
We need a family, which can be a physical family or a church, as a foundation.
 
Jeremiah 29:4
 
When the people of God were in exile, running away from their oppressors, they lost hope. So God spoke to them and told them to build homes, plant gardens, marry and have children.
 
God is there. Even in hard times, there is a plan He has for you. If you are in trouble, plant something. Build a foundation. Grow roots. Remind yourself that you are in the healthy family of God.
Your future is not determined by what you have done in the past, but by what God has promised for you.
 
4 rocks to build a strong family:
 
1)**Hope:**
a.     Hope means trust, it means a belief for something better. You need to learn trusting God. Hope can come to you if you decide to plant yourself in your church family. When you have nothing in your circumstances, when there is nothing you can do out of your own strength to improve them, praise God and trust in Him to provide for you.

2)**Opportunity:**
a.     You need to give opportunity to others and allow yourself opportunities (also give yourself and others opportunities to mess up). Sometimes people will come to church to spread trouble. But in that, God is giving you the opportunity to love that person anyway, clean up the mess and stay on the journey.

3)**Memories:**
a.     A good life is a life that builds memories for generations. Good memories are stored and we as a church can build good memories for others, so that they can remember that there are people in Berlin who live differently and who provide for them without pay or expectations and who place value on them (like at the dinner parties in the park). Memories give us a long term perspective through hard times.

4)**Empowerment:**
a.     Empowerment and giving opportunity go together. You can tell your kid “go and do it” (opportunity) but you also need to train and equip them to actually carry out the task (empowerment). Tell people you will be with them on the journey.
 
With these rocks, you can make it HOME, a place where people can come and are accepted and welcomed even if they mess up. To give something of yourself to others is the best thing you can do.
In order for these rocks to have a foundation, you have to build them on the cornerstone that is Jesus.
 
Your future is already determined. It has been finished at the cross. Your future is complete and holy. So build yourself on Jesus because it is the only foundation that will last.
