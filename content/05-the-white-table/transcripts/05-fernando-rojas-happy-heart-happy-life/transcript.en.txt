Text: **Proverbs 4:23**

Heart is mentioned:
- **twice** as much than heaven
- **twice** as much than prayer
- **more than twice** as much than sin

so that means the heart is very important to God, a very important issue for him!

“guard your heart above all else” 
because from it comes all life, it determines our whole lives!

8000 l of blood go through your heart each day. And like that it reaches the whole body.
When you “sit down” for too long, you get cramps and the blood stops circulating, which hurts you, beacuse not all parts are reached with blood. That’s when it hurts. 
Then you need to move! 

Same with our spiritual life/heart! 
If we just sit, not moving, but waiting for God to move, we get “cramps” and it hurts and your body actually tells you that something hurts! Then you call out to God but he actually tells you: “Move!” 
At first it will continue hurting when you move and walk around but just for very short and then you feel better and actually healthy!
Move and dont stop.


**What is your spiritual heart?**

1. **Your Conviction**
	Acts 4:32
	Matthew 15:8

2. **Your Values**
	Matthew 6:21

3. **Your Beliefs**
	Mark 12:30
	Romans 10:9-10

How can we keep a healthy heart?..

- Take care of what’s coming in to your heart!!
- Make sure you’re connected to the right source of life & the right surrounding! (the people that can speak into you!)
- Exercise your faith! (Prayer and Belief!)
	(In times you can feed well on the other hand but when you only sit down, not moving, 
	you will get fat)
	f.ex. paying for the coffee for the person behind you in the queue although you don’t 
know him!
- Sharing the Love with all the people around you! be light & salt


Lets never take for granted that we as a church actually have this culture of wanting to build the church of the Lord, enlarging God’s House.
We might hear it a lot, but not all the churches know this or talk about it! 
About stepping forward and enlarging and bigger opportunities & growth! 
Let’s keep this fresh.

Proverbs 4:23 Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it

The heart is the center of life for the human body

Some facts about the heart

The heart beats 100,000 times per day
Sends 8,000 liters of blood through the body system.

A good laugh increases blood circulation 20% and therefore healing your body.

In the bible the heart is mentioned over 800 times, twice as much as heaven, pray, or sin.

Heart is a very important subject from Gods perspective and our perspective

The heart has 2 main functions.

Pump blood (keep life running) the heart irrigates every part of the body even the lad corner of it.


Clean and filter the blood
Bringing blood full of toxics on one side and then connecting with the lunges to bring oxygen and renewal on the other side


The same happens with our spiritual heart


3 parts of our spiritual heart

Convictions-- a firmly held opinion.  Things you do because you know they are right.
Convictions can be controlled by our mind and past perceptions

Acts 4:32
All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had

Matthew 15:8 “‘These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.

Luke 12:29 And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it.


Values-- principles or standards of behaviour; one's judgement of what is important in life.

Matthew 6:21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

Luke 8:15
But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.

Mat. 23:1-3
Now Jesus turned to address his disciples, along with the crowd that had gathered with them. “The religion scholars and Pharisees are competent teachers in God’s Law. You won’t go wrong in following their teachings on Moses. But be careful about following them. They talk a good line, but they don’t live it. They don’t take it into their hearts and live it out in their behavior. It’s all spit-and-polish veneer


Beliefs-- an acceptance that something exists or is true, especially one without proof.


Mark 12:30
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’

Acts 2:26 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest in hope,

Romans 10:9-10
Romans 10:9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
Romans 10:10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.
