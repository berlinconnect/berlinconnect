Text: **1 Corinthians 12:21-24**
everyone is important to the body of Christ!

What God is doing in Berlin through Berlin Connect is nothing but miraculous!! total supernatural, it’s not just “us turning up on sundays”. Lets never take this for granted and lighthearted!

If we bring the word honour back in our church lives, we can 

Its not important who comes first or who comes last, its only about finishing the race together and doing what is valued!!
(Story: Lee’s little 5 year old daughter ran her first race in school. The teacher said they needed to run with their sun-hats on. Lee’s daughter was the first, about a meter in front of the other kids. Then short before she reached the final line her hat flew away and she… turns around to pick up the hat. She came in last! In the end though… all the kids were jumping around behind the finishing line in joy! The didnt value WHO came in last or first, the just valued that they ALL finished the race TOGETHER with their hats still on.
They valued what the teacher said!)



**Psalm 100:4**
Enter the doors with THANKSGIVING!!!

...whatever you enter his gates with you will come out with even MORE!! thats why = HONOUR! & THANKSGIVING!!

1. **Honour precedes faith!**
**Great team:**
When you know whatever you’re doing in your team = you’re changing the world & building his kingdom! Although its very small and seems not important!! You need faith to see it.<br>

2. **Honour always returns abundantly!**

COME into the CHURCH with expectancy and the will do the supernatural!
100% responsibility to take the most out of everything to move your life forward will always take you more forward.
**Mark 4:24**

Honour will ALWAYS come back to you!!! and even more!
Encouragement

(When you are a worshipper, worshipping HIM – he will always pour his love down. He will always give!  (but we’re worshipping him alone. That’s why its not important if we “like” the worship or not because we are NOT the ones who are worshipped!)<br>

3. **Honour unlocks the miraculous!**
**Proverbs 3:9**
If you honour him, he will make sure your barns & co are full!
Only you can hinder him!
