Text: It doesn’t matter if its raining or hailing or whatever else but BE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD. Make this decision - it will affect your children as well.
 
In the old testament the people were so passionate for the house of the lord that they brought TOO much. Too many treasures. In the end they had to tell the people to stop bringing!
 
**1.Kings 8:20-21**
**1.Kings 8:43**
(the house has your name on it)
**1.Kings 9:3**
(built the house in his name and he will be in it forever)
 
**Ephesians 2:19-22 MSG**
Being in Gods home, part of it, he is using all of us brick by brick with Jesus as the cornerstone.
 
Jesus and his church are one body.
Like the body and the head or a married couple.
You cant separate a husband and a wife.
Like them you just CANT separate JESUS AND HIS CHURCH.
One body.
 
We are a family. Gods family.
Meeting around a table for example.
And on that table we can help so many people.
 
How can we translate “fellowship” into our modern English?
You cannot… its maybe a dusty word, we are gods people and we are fellowshipping!
(= to actually share, to be in unit, to be in partnership and ALL through the HOLY SPIRIT)
 
Maybe you can be a friend, a mum/dad or even a daughter/son for someone.
You can be used by God to encourage others to have a seat at the table.
You can be used by God to be a help for people out there.
