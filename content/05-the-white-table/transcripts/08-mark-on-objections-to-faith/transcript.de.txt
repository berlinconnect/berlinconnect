Text: **Short recap**
People have objections to faith:

- exclusivity : How can there only be one true religion?
=> narrow ways lead to broadness

- intolerance: Why are Christians intolerant to other religions?
=> Jesus did hang out with all kinds of people – we are called to do the same

- absolutism: Don’t we all have to find truth for ourselves?
=> it’s a challenge because Jesus said we cannot figure it out ourselves – we need to

**More in detail**

People have objections to faith. What kind of objections can be there?

- intellectual clash: At first it’s hard to understand intellectually, but after research and finding out more about the basics of Christianity this makes sense.

- exclusivity: How can there only be one true religion? We have so many choices, information, different world views. Our society likes having options. Part of the fundamental problem of pluralism is that you are actually not making a choice at all and you are paralyzed. Jesus makes the statement that he is the only way. With Jesus as the narrow way we have a way that lead to broadness and incredible inclusiveness towards others. Essence of religion is you have to strive to come to God. Essence of Christianity is a God who strives for you. Knowing that you couldn’t earn his love should actually make you more tolerant to accept people who are and think different. Tolerance is when we are not agreeing but treating each other with great respect. 

- do all the religions say the same? Grace is given as a gift to us. This grace exchange is quite unique.

- is Christianity just a philosophy? It’s not just a mental construct. It always deals with the whole person, body, mind and spirit.

It’s ok to doubt, but don’t just stay there. A doubt is like a belief. Investigate your doubts the same way you do your beliefs.
