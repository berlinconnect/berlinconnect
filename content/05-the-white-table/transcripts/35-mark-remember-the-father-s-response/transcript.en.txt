Text: **Prelude:** 
720 people working together to rescue one climber who had fallen and broken his bones in the mountains. After 2 weeks, they got to him and rejoiced. May we never forget the importance of working together to save the ONE. 
The gospel is about the ONE who came to save the many.
We need to go looking for the ONE in our lives. 

**Message:**
Continuation of last week’s message from Luke 15: Remember the Father’s response.
Jesus talks to two different groups of people: liberalists and legalists.

The three stories are actually one:
1. The lost sheep: the Father is a shepherd and He goes after the ONE.
2. The lost coin: the Church is the continuation - with the help of the Holy Spirit - of God’s work on earth.
3. The two lost sons:  God responds in the same way: Come home.

In the first two stories, something is lost and someone goes looking. In the third one, someone is lost and no one goes looking.

Acts 2:41-47 NLT: It is God’s will for people to be brought home into His house → added to the Church
God wants to add lost sons and daughters to His Church, His family, His solutions right now: The question is: can He do that in our Church right now? 

Relationships are super-important. The Church started where there were Godly, healthy relationships and connections. Are you connected to Christ?

In our culture, we want the fun etc, but we don’t want to work for it - no commitment. But what do you do when someone let’s you down? You turn to someone who is always there. What you connect to will determine your life.

Let’s build the kind of church God can work with in Berlin. And for that we need to let people in and build friendships. Be wise about whom you let in though. 

What did people see that they liked in Acts 2:41-47: We are ALL ministers of the Gospel. 2 Corinthians 5:14-21. Everyone has been given the responsibility to bring restoration.
 
Jesus is big on people - Nice people, not so nice people, etc…

We are either going to be the church - or not. Let’s take on the role of the older brother. 
Think community. Summer momentum is community.
