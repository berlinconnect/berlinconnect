Text: Luke 15 – The Prodigal Son
 
Rembrandt spent a lot of time and effort to capture the heart of God in his painting “the return of the prodigal son”, using his amazing skills to express God’s glory just before the end of his life.
 
What would be the sequel to the story of the prodigal son? How would the story continue from the perspective of the older brother?
 
The older brother could keep striving for his fathers love, never being fully able to receive forgiveness, never learning how to be a son, being bitter and acting out of obligation.
 
But what would Jesus have said to the older brother? We can get an idea in Matthew 11:28-30, where he reveals the Father’s heart.
 
As believers, we are the sequel, the continuation of the story, both collectively and individually. We represent the kingdom of God in whatever situation we find ourselves in. We are given authority over every situation, acting as His ambassadors in the world. We are not spectators or witnesses, we are called to be actively bringing our church forward and welcoming people home.
 
If you act like an older brother, it will form the perception people who do not know Christ have of His church. So watch and observe Jesus so that they can see Him in your actions instead.
