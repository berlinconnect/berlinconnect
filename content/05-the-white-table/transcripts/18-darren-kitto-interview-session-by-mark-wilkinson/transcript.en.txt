Text: **How to Increase our capacity**
You can’t keep living the way you always did if you want to grow and be a leader.
To be a great leader you need to change all the time to grow your capacity.
As responsibility comes, our life needs to be enlarged. 
It’s important, that you don’t spend your whole life to please others!
If you are in a specific function, you are there to fulfill your role; its not just a position; you are there for a purpose.

**How to be a leader**
Your calling as a leader is to invest into people. Therefore, you need to value them and gain their trust. Without people trusting you, you cannot help them moving forward.
When the people you lead trust you, you have the opportunity to empower them.
You need to look people in the eye and say: “you need to change to enlarge your capacity”
It’s not about how skilled they are, its about how they can enlarge their leadership in specific areas.
As a leader you work with people on the “little things” - you always ask yourself: “what is their next personal step in every part of their life?”

**About the Power of YES and NO**
Especially in volunteering and in stepping up in new roles, its most of the time easier to say yes than to live the „yes“.
Some people learned to say NO before they say YES - this limits God in this area. But if we say YES to do things, we get changed in the process.
People say yes to something, but then they fail and don’t allow themselves to say YES again. But a YES gets easier when you say it more often.
You need to say YES to the things that you are called to do, to others things you need the ability to say NO. You got to grow your NO so that you can bless your YES.

You need people more ahead of you challenging and speaking to your potential.
Sometimes it’s hurtful, because you don’t understand everything in this moment, but it’s about you as a leader moving forward. 

You can’t tell people that you are for them; you have to show them that you are for them.

There are times when the team needs something that is not really gonna be your strength, but the team needs you doing it - that’s what you need to do.
