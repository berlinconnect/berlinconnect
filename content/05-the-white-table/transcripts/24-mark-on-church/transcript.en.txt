Text: I want to go to a Church where...

1) A Church where people love going to church; a church that loves the House of God.
People plant themselves in the House of God because they met Jesus. No one can make you stay in the Church, only your relationship with Jesus.

2) A Church that loves and values leadership, because leadership is example. Leadership is influence; it is placing value on people, speaking to people’s potential, pointing to vision.
You will never place value on someone else if you don’t value yourself. What kind of example are you giving to people following you? Is there any leadership in your life worth following?

3) A Church where people are not afraid to take responsibility. 
Are you able to take and carry repsonsibility? 

4) A Church that makes the vision their own. Not only “that’s the leader’s vision”, but that’s my vision. Ownership is normal. 

5) A Church that wants to serve each other. What can I do to help others? People that are living to serve!

6) A Church that values unity. Anyone who is united sacrifices individuality for the common good.

7) A Church where people love leading people to Jesus. People who are passionate about seeing lost sons and daughters coming home.

8) A Church where people care about each other. Why would anyone want to go to a Church where nobody cares? Caring for others is not a job title or a roster; imagine how it would look like if we all cared.

9) A Church where people desire to contribute. Everyone can contribute in different ways.

10) A Church that has a can do spirit. “We can do that!” 

11) A Church that values bringing a good report. A Church of real obstacles, mistakes and challenges; but also full of good reports - without God I would be finished.

12) A Church where they love doing life together - Love God, Love people, Love life.
A Church where it’s fun!

Write down this week: 
What kind of Church do I want to go to? 
And what can I do to make that a reality? 

Your “want to” is very attractive, let’s build an atmosphere where there is freedom
