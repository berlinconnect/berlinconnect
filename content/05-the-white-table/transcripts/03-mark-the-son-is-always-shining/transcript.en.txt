Text: Things happen in life but you have to make the decision that only the good things stick to you.

God is calling us to build the kind of church that gets the attention of people who wouldn’t be normally found in church.

**Vision of the church, us as Berlin Connect:**
- Reposition church Jesus & His church in the minds of secular Europe.
- By building a large Christ centered bible - based church in the heart of Europe.
- Changing mindsets & empowering people to lead and impact in every sphere of life.

It’s breaking my heart that so many people today have a wrong perception of Jesus! 

The danger with google-ing the word “**church**” is that you find that the common meaning is beautiful old buildings but only the building. 
And that is sad because this has never been church.
Another danger: that nowadays we would find blue lights & stage shows & auditorium

**But the church is and ALWAYS has been: about PEOPLE!!! 
only about people.**

We are sons and daughters of the most high. But also as son & daughters our responsibility and privilege is laying the table for other lost children to come home and get close to our father!

The thing that people from the outside will notice in about a second when they come in:
**AUTHENTICITY**!

**The message is eternal but the methods are generational!**

Build with hospitality & generosity
Service = one size fits all!
Hospitality = I notice you!

**Heart for the House** stands for so many lives and people YET TO COME to Christ!


first 5 years of BC:
**LEADERSHIP Generation**
5.-10. year:
**HISTORY MAKING Generation**


**Message: “WITH JESUS IT’S ALWAYS SUMMER”**
Stop  living like it’s winter and start living like it’s summer
Hebrews 12
Ephesians 1:1-4
Colossians 1:18-23
**Why do people stop?**
1. Distraction
	No one is immune to it!
We have more knowledge and resources than ever before at our fingertips.
	Jesus had every reason to be distracted! But he had his eyes on the joy that was 
before him, beyond the cross! we don't know if he knew everything beyond it but he trusted his father!
2. Discouragement
	To build the church we’re trying to build we need to be brave and courageous.
3. Defeat
	Living in the past, thinking of your own mistake
	“Holy, blameless and wihtout a single fault!”... that’s what God sees in you!
4. Division
Having a divided heart. 
5. Deception
	So many people are pulled out of the light is because they were deceived. You 
need to walk in the truth DAILY, remind yourself!

**Why do people keep going?**
1. Focus
	focused on him. When we dont focus on Jesus, we might look at people and we 
might not like what we see. But with Jesus the way we look at people changes!
2. Courage
We are here to make church history in this nation!
3. Victory
Live from victory, not live from defeat! LEARN from defeat. but LIVE from VICTORY
4. Unity
	Stay together both outwardly & inwardly. But that doesnt mean you should be the 
same.
5. Truth
	You have to walk in the truth daily. We have a future because Jesus is so amazing!!



When Jesus was about to:

1. get distracted → he chose to FOCUS on his mission
2. get discouraged → he found COURAGE in his father
3. get defeated → he was VICTORIOUS (the cross looked like a terrible defeat but it turned out to be the biggest Victory throughout history!
