Text: In times like this we are aware of things like the persecution in Iraq, we are shocked, but at the same time we notice again… that that’s the reason we are here. The church of Jesus.
 
**COMMUNION :**
When we take communion – anyone that’s facing health problems – the most powerful thing we can do is taking communion!
“My body was broken for your health and your …”  HE IS OUR HEALER!
 
Communion = also saying that we only look to Jesus – that we don’t look to human approval but only to JESUS!
 
 
 
**MESSAGE**

**“TAKE INITIATIVE”**
Initiative is healthy!
Healthy people will always show initiative.
A healthy church will always show initiative.
 
Matt 7:12 MSG
 “Here is a simple, rule-of-thumb guide for behavior: Ask yourself what you want people to do for you, then grab the INITIATIVE and do it for them. Add up God’s Law and Prophets and this is what you get.”
 
Initiative takes instructions. We are all students before we are teachers.
You can’t lead without following. Good leaders are always good followers first!
Initiative listens to instructions!
 
Initiative takes responsibility!
 
Initiative is observant!
 
Initiative asks questions!
 
Initiative brings up solutions, highlights good reports!
 
Initiative will always get the attention of the leader, decision-maker!
 
Initiative always flows with authority, not undermines authority!
 
Initiative takes action!
 
Initiative will always set you apart!

Learn from the mistakes you make and don’t be afraid of failure. Fear of failure is not going to stop us of our god-given purpose to live a full life. A life full of initiative!
 
1.Samuel 17
David and Goliath
The father tells David to go bring sandwiches to his brothers in battle, look after them and return home to bring him a good report.
But  what did David do?...
1.     He listened to instructions (he left and took the food)
2.     But he also took initiative! (the father didn’t tell him to give his sheep to another shepard, which he did!!)
He took initiative when being on the battle field. He observed, asked questions,  wanted a solution, flowed with authority (before King Saul), didn’t compare himself to other men and went and fought and had victory!!!
