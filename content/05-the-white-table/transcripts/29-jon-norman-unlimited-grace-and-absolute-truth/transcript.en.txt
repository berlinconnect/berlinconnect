Text: Jesus is grace and Jesus is also truth.
We need forgiveness and we also need instruction.

3 absolutes of grace and truth:

**1. Grace and truth are one**
What is your image of God?
He is full of grace and full of truth because they are one.

**2. Grace is who we are, Truth is what you do.**
When you let Jesus in, grace and truth abide in you.
You inject grace before you operate with truth.
If you only inject truth and don’t operate with truth, nothing changes.
inject some grace into your broken relationships.
When you fill someone with grace you can speak truth.
If you speak truth with no grace, you can destroy relationships.
One of the reasons people leave Church is because they only want grace. But truth is what moves your life forward.
Grace catches you but truth moves your life forward.
Jesus built His Church on grace.
Surround yourself with people full of grace and truth.
Have you ever asked someone: What is it really mean to be on the other side of me?
Allow people to speak into your life.

**3. Grace catches you, truth leads you.**
Truth grows you. God is your Saviour but He is also our Lord
The Saviour is grace, the Lord is truth.
Every single time you mess up, grace catches you.
Truth leads you forward, the Lord will lead your life. - reading the Word, coming to Church,  having honest conversations.
You don’t fall out of grace you fall into it.
Truth points us to grace, Grace points us to truth.
