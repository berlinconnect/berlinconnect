Text: Psalm 23
John 10:8-18

Lack is easy. If you want lack just do nothing.
If you want a garden full of weeds, just do nothing.
If you want a beautiful garden, you’ll need to work hard. It is a commitment.
It’s the same with your life; building your life is a commitment.

How do you build your life in a consistent manner?
We build from strength to strength. But where does this strength come from? It comes from your relationship with God.
To be strong is a blessing. Even in your weakness you attract God’s strength.

God is big and everything is redeemable.
There is  nothing God can’t turn around.  He can take any mistake you made and turn it around. 

“My cup overflows with blessing” is God’s intention for our lives.
It means “I am satisfied”- If you’ve got Jesus you’ve got everything.
It is the will of God that you are satisfied.
Because of Jesus nothing is missing, nothing is broken.

The challenge is to align our belief to the word of God despite of my current experience is.
How much do you need to have/accomplish/achieve until you are satisfied?
Human nature is never satisfied because we have forgotten who we are.

You can have a broad life and not be satisfied;
You can have a narrow life in Jesus and be satisfied.

The purpose of Jesus is to give you a rich and satisfying life.
Jesus frees you more than you could ever imagine.
What will define your life more than anything else is your ability to let go.
Religion talks about the fruit “fruit-language” (behaviour), Jesus talks about root “root-language” (identity, who you are in Christ).

Christ positions you in a place of satisfaction. 
Never allow someone’s else's success.
