Text: This day may comes with wonderful feelings for others not so much. On Mothersday there can not only be a lot of joy but also a lot of pain and guilt... But it’s so important to realize that Calvary covers it all, there is no shame and guilt anymore. It’s ok to not be perfect, there was only one who was perfect and His Name in Jesus Christ. 
Regardless on which side we are if on the positive or the challenging side when it comes to parents and parenting, it’s important to look at our potential. This is what Jesus does all the time: he places value, speaks to potential and points to vision. Everyone of us can thank you mother for giving birth to you, you can thank your father for giving the identity (chromosoms are defining if it is a boy or a girl) - so they played a vital part! There is purpose to your life!
The point here that is very important: It is our heavenly father that gives us our identity!!! 
Romans 8:11 The same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead lives in us! We have the deposit of  the Holy Spirit in us. 
John 16:7-8 Jesus had to say this is the truth! This is our identity, this is where we should live from. Living our future with our eyes on who you are in Christ.
