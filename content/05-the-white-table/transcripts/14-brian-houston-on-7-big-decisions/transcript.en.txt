Text: You should never make permanent decisions in temporary circumstances. There are 7 big decisions we are making that have generational impact for our children and their children.

**WHO: The importance of who you marry.**
- If you find someone that is even more in love with Jesus than yourself, you are in good hands.
- If you have different goals than your partner, if you are heading into different directions, marriage might not work out.
- Look for someone that makes you love
- Look for someone with passion
- Find someone that is consistent in his decisions before and after the wedding
- Embrace the seasons you are in.

If you are drawing towards a thought too much, it becomes an imagination and an imagination can become a stronghold. For some thoughts you need to decide “Im not gonna go there in my mind.” #decisions #berlinsundays
 
Life has seasons. And we can get frustrated with where we are right now. Embrace the season you are in and honour God for what he has given you already. #decisions #berlinsundays
 
**WHERE: The importance of where you are living.**
- Sometimes your calling needs you to change destinations, even when it’s uncomfortable (Calling over comfort)
- Don’t decide to move only because of your job or your family – decide where to move on community, church and your calling.
 
Choose calling over comfort when it comes to your destination. #decisions #berlinsundays
 
**WHAT: The importance of what you do.**
- Ideally, do what you are good at.
- Basically, do what God calls you to do!
- The fulfillment of what God has called you to do is the happiest life you could live.
-  If it’s not flowing, it might not be the will of God.

**WHEN: The importance of timing.**
- Make decisions in the right time.
- Sometimes you can get the right place and the right people right  - but without the right time it is not going to work.
- God has a good sense of timing – but most of the time it is not our timing.


**WITH: The importance of friendships & relationships.**
- bad company corrupts good habits.
- don’t surround yourself by people with bad attitudes, gossip, etc.
- make tough decisions about who you are hanging with.
- 2 Cor, 6-11
 
Make strong choices about your friendships: Bad company corrupts good habits. #decisions #berlinsundays
 
**WHY: The importance of the right motives.**
- Sometimes you can do the right things for the wrong reasons.
- Sometimes it is our motivation to make our fathers proud – but more than that let’s focus on what God called us to do and make people proud on the way.
- Just do what you do because you want to help people.
 
If you keep your motives right, you don’t need to chase blessing, blessing will be chasing you! #decisions #berlinsundays
 
No matter what we are called to do, it should always be about God and people. #decisions #servingspirit #berlinsundays
 
**WISH: The importance of what you wish for.**
- Ask for wisdom, because wisdom will build your live because you ask for anything else.
 
Sometimes starting too early can be the worst for your life.

If you want anything in life, believe God for wisdom. Wisdom is going to build your house. #decisions #berlinsundays
