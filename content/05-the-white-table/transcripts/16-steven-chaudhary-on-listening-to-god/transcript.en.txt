Text: Listen to what Jesus & God said !
 
Matthew 7:25
“… anyone who takes my advice, is like a wise man!”
 
Jesus gave us this warning!
 
Jesus knew that there will be people who would hear his words and his advice, but still they wouldn’t listen.
 
How did that probably feel for him?...
 
 
James 1:24-25
 
 
Joshua 1:2
 
 
You will be blessed and God will be with those who do as commanded!!
No one.
If you do!
If you step out and do what God has told you to do ,  YES you will have opposition, BUT no one will be able stand against you!
 
Jesus said, if you SPEAK to your mountain, it will bow down.
 
 
Jeremiah 7:23
 
Anytime you  put the word of God in action in your life, you  will move forward! Forward momentum!
You step out of the darkness, into light!
You  step out of a seating position, into a standing position!
WE  STAND in Gods presence!
 
 
 
 
 
**One question:
 
IF THERE IS SO MUCH BLESSING AND SUCCESS IN THE WORD, THEN WHY  DO SO FEW OF DO THE WORD OF GOD?....**
 
There are so many messages, we are so over-ressourced, but still sometimes people/we don’t believe it or do nothing with the things they hear and know.
 
We should be doers of the word,  and not hearers!
 
Sometimes we think that the answer is so simple, that we think its beneath us…
 
 
 
James 1:22-23
Do the word!! Don’t just listen!!
 
 
 
**Forgetfulness** is the churches biggest official enemy.
Its such a simple thing but its bad!...
The bible says so many times: REMEMBER….
We are forgetful hearers of the word…
 
 
If you step aside of the things you got, you are neglecting them and forgetting them.
 
 
In order to not forget God gave us some signs and images!!!
RAINBOW !!
COMMUNION !!
TITHING !!
 
 
We are encouraged to do two thing:
1.     to LOOK  (put our attention to something)
2.     to CONTINUE   (to remain beside something, to always be near)
 
 
God has made his word so accessible to us, but so often we let other things be more important in our lives.
 
 
GOD WANTS YOU TO SUCCEED  MORE THAN YOU WANT TO SUCCEED!
 
Forgetfulness will cause you to stagnate in every part of your life.
