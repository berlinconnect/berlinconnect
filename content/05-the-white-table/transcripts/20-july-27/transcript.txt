Joshua 6

Are you on the verge of losing your passion for what you are doing? How are you responding?
We have exceeding great promises in God.
Jericho had high walls of protection.
God spoke in past tense about a battle that hadn’t happened yet - the same way He speaks in past tense about the battle you are fighting now.

1) Our perspective can be blocked.
What do you do when what you see is nothing like what God is saying in your spirit?
It wasn’t the size of Jericho that was challenging but the hight of the walls.
The intensity of the opposition in your life i the proof of god’s promise in your life.
The enemy was intimidated; that’s why the walls were protected.
Praise lifts your perspective to see beyond the problems.

2) Our progress isn’t always obvious.
They were 40 years in the desert. And for 7 seven days nothing moved.
We walk by faith and not by sight.
Will you keep walking even when it doesn’t seem to be working?
When you pray and nothing moves, can you believe God is moving anyway?
Can you keep forgiving even if the person doesn’t reciprocate?
Obedience is our resposibility, outcome is God’s resposibility.
The battle within us is more important than the one outside us.
It is in the wandering that our faith is developed.
Just because your progress isn’t obvious, it doesn’t mean you faith isn’t working.
The promise still stands, even if the wall still stands between you and and it.

It is not your walking, or your shout that brings the wall down. But He who begun a good work in you will be faithful and will finish it.

Lord we trust you to take care of the outcomes, we keep our eyes on you.
