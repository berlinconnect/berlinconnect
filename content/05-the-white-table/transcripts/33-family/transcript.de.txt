Text: Family is God’s idea. We have been adopted in God’s family.
God’s family is the Church of the Living God. 
The head of our spiritual family: God the Father. 
We need to have more faith in our heavenly father, more than in us.
Majority of humanity is looking for: unconditional love, acceptance, inclusion, approval, being valued. 
We as a church have all of that, we have what the world is looking for. 

Being a healthy family means going back to the basics: 
We eat together. Sunday is spiritual nourishment. The whole day is the message. We need to leave things by side and make it a priority. Regardless of what your taste buds prefer, it is still good for you, because there is nutrition in that food. During the week we need to meditate and digest. Doing life together. We do the up and downs together. There is always tricky situations. Being a family is not based on our feelings, it is based on our commitment towards each others. We can all play a part in the life of others. 
As a spiritual family we support each other. Connection equals care.
Fellowship is the cementing of people together for a greater cause that can only be done because of the power of the Holy Spirit. Love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control is part of our DNA. The fruits of the Spirit help us with everything in live. 
The cementing of people is only possible in an atmosphere where the Holy Spirit is loved embraced and obeyed. Let’s be this kind of family, Church!
