**“God’s Goodness for your life”**

Phillipians 2:1-16 MSG

Some mindsets of people:

…many people **want the favor of God but they don’t want the truth**.
	We live in a culture where we always want the next best thing.
	They want the benefits but they are not quite sure if they want Jesus himself.

…they **want the rewards but not the work**.
	If you don’t work you normally don’t eat!!

… they **want to be blessed but they dont want the Blesser**!


→ BUT you can’t blame anyone else you need to take RESPONSIBILITY!
→ We have a Reference Point.
	Let CHRIST be your reference point!! 
→ Our relationship with Jesus can’t be only on a picture, it needs to be based on his presence. 
We need him! 
→ He wants us to build DEEP-spirited friendships
→ Understand that it’s not about us
→ We’re here to BUILD a church for his glory
	Church = people	
	That means we’re here to build the LIVES of people
→ It’s all about JESUS, that’s why we can lay a table for others and be generous.
	It’s not hard to build a table of hospitality and a spirit of generosity, if we concentrate on 
Jesus!
→ We are called to be a FRESH breath of air
→ We are called to be the TRUTH
