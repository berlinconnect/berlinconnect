Text: Rejection is a global epidemic which we all face on a daily basis.
Let’s not get slowed down by rejection, because rejection has a way of destroying a person's life in a way that few other things can.

Hebrews 12:1
Paul is saying to the Hebrews, we gotta deal with everything that holds us back in this life. Rejection is a hindrance.

We can carry rejection with us through life, but it will slow us down in the race of life. Jesus want you to leave the weights behind, because he already paid the price for it. 
As long as your alive and you are around people you will experience rejection. 
Jesus was not immune against rejection: He was rejected before he even entered the world when Maria and Joseph couldn’t find a place to stay. On his first day in ministry people tried to stone him to death. When Jesus went to the cross he carried our rejection, so he felt rejected. 
Why does rejection wound us so deeply?

John 10:10 NLT 
God never designed you to feel rejection. It’s the opposite of who Christ is.
The root of rejection is misplaced identity. If we place our identity on somebody or something else than Christ, we will feel rejected. Rejection always bares negative fruits.The fruit of rejection is isolation. Rejections best friends is isolation. A predator always attacks from the fringes of the flock. The moment you isolate yourself you are under attack. 
It’s amazing what we see and hear from the edge. Stay in the house. 
There is a solution to solve rejection:

**1. Accept, that your identity in Christ.** 
We solve our identity problems we solve our rejection problems. When we place our identity solely on the Word of God we become rejection-proofed.
1 John 3:1 
Pslam 27:10 Accepted by your heavenly father. 
Psalm 139:14 
God in Heaven doesn’t see wringles, pimples, curves in the wrong places - he sees who you really are: marvelous! He created you just the way you are - he loves you.

John calls himself John the Beloved: you only hear about him refered in that way  in John, not in the other books of the Bible. So John just had a revelation of who he was.
 
Psalm 103
Past, present and future sins have been completely removed. God doesn’t judge you. He sees Jesus in you. Jesus already paid for it. 

**2. Accept that rejection is not a failure.**

Rejection is not failure.
Rejection is a comma in your life it’s not a full stop.
When you understand rejection isn't failure you will have confidence to get up again 

**3. Accept love never fails**
The last thing Jesus did on this earth was, he accepted the thiev next to him on the cross. Today he accepts you. Forgiveness is not an option on the journey of overcoming rejection.
The hardest part about rejection is that you need to forgive the peple in your life that rejected and hurt you the most. 
The alternative is that you carry the weights instead, but it will slow you down…
Barry the feeling of rejection.It releases chains in your life and in the life of others. 
Sometimes there are crossways in your life where you need to make this decision!
1. Forgive them in your heart
2. Bless them out loud - speak it out, tell someone
3. Reconcile with them
