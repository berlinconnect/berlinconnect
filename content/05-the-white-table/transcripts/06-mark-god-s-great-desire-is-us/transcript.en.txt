Text: **EVERY CHURCH NEEDS MOMENTUM!!!**
We need people “pushing the car up the hill”. The more people that get involved and start adding value, the easier it is to move forward. Church is not for spectators. Momentum is a friend and we need to get serious about it. 

HEART FOR THE HOUSE is at the perfect time to say “we’re not just watching, we’re actually participating” 
We’re here to take new ground!!!

**Message:**
**“God’s Great desire is us”**

1.Chronicles 29: 1- 10

It’s an insight to the heart of God. God desires not our service, but US.

Are we excited about building the house of God? 

(Tower of Babel)

In the beginning everybody spoke the same language.
Its amazing when everybody is on the same page – or speaks the same language – what you can accomplish!

And all of the sudden they didn’t understand each other anymore… confusion.

If you read the story, you see that those people took bricks to build that tower all the same size & shape!

But when people would build an altar for God they would use stones!! Because they are unique, not is the same. 
God calls us to be unique. SHINE brightly! We are to be unique. 
You’ll find your uniqueness in God!
If God’s get involved, you will find that you have never been more unique and like “yourself”!!

We are STONES. We are ourselves. Being in the house of the lord doesn't make you a copycat. 
We are all different but still we are building ONE house.

Psalms 8:4-5
God made man in his own image. All of creation has his touch, but we have his heart!
God gave us the responsibility of planet Earth in the beginning.

Moses build a tent for God.
Solomon build a Temple for God.
God says at the end of the old testament: “I don’t want your buildings. Look what I am going to build!”

GOD WANTS TO MAKE HIS HOME IN YOU AND ME!! 

He thinks that the temple in us is better than any beautiful building!!!
GOD doesn’t want gold - HE wants you!!
GOD doesn’t want your achievements - HE wants you!

**HE WANTS TO DWELL IN US!**

**“....They were young and untested…”**
A lot of us are young and unproven.
But God  just needs some faithful people. 
Ready to build whatever needs to be done! 
We might be young but that doesn’t mean our hearts not in it!!! 
Roll up our sleeves and go for it. We will not shut up. Its a time to rise up!

No circumstances stop the church. 
God doesn’t depend on anything. 
And this is God’s House!!

There is more against us than for us, but HEY – THERE IS SOMEBODY FOR US!
When God is on your case, he can even soften the hardest hearts!

Lets better be part of the answer of than part of the problem!

**“....Their heart was in it…”**
They were willing & ready.
Is your heart in it?
You can’t do anything worthwhile for the honour of God if you’re hearts’s not in it!


**“...But God’s hand is upon him (Salomon)”**
Gods hand is upon this generation!!!
The work is huge, huge challenges. 

You got to get rooted and place yourself under vision in the house of the Lord.
Live a lifestyle of BEING READY and BEING PREPARED for Gods plans. 
Don’t tell yourself that “you’ll think about it when the plan arrives” because than it is too late!!

Are we preparing for the next generation?...
When they build the temple they were building it as a community.
When we build something we build it as a community.

LET ALL OUR HEARTS BE IN IT!! 
Heart for the House comes just at the right time really.

The key to a healthy life is a healthy heart. 
An uncluttered heart! 
A focused heart!
Let’s make room in our hearts for God to move.
