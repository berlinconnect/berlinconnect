- we can apply what Paul mentions here in the 21st century


**what society do we live in?**
We have more freedom, more prosperity, more everything! we sometimes forget why do we have all these amazing things. We live in a individualistic society: we take what we like, but avoid what we have to give, shrink all down to our own interests
It’s like saying i want what jesus has to offer, but i don’t want him. I want the moment, but not the rest of my life devoted. You don’t get something out of church, if you don’t put anything in it. 


**We have to make willingly small steps, based on truth that you do know
Understand: Jesus owes you nothing. If you have Him, you have everything. God just loves you, because He loves you**

**4 points**

**1. build deep spirited friends**
- let christ be your example in everything, friendly is nice, but friendship is better
- comes out of a relationship with jesus
- lets not build consumerism in our church

**2. be energetic in your life of salvation**
- take it into your marketplace, working place,
- doesn’t mean you have to talk about jesus, let people see, its not only in my heart, its also on the outside, like a smile on my face

**3. be a breath of fresh air**
- people come with preconceived ideas, but they see a table full of generosity and hospitality
- when everyone gossips, choose to speak life
- if you have a Christian background and you call it home, be open for new ways to do things
- empathy, let people share, not talking about your things, value people, put love and grace on people
- we are not there to convert, we are there to love and lift people

**4. be living proof**
- out of His strength, don’t underestimate knowing jesus
- let your life show evidence of His goodness
