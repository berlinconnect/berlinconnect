Text: The word discipline means standard. It’s important to renew our mind about what discipline means.  It’s not negative. When God disciplines us he is showing us His standard and measurement. God’s standard is Christ on the cross! He disciplines us to bring us back to Him. It’s the most uplifting discipline. It’s getting you back to His love. You either live in his love or you live in His discipline. 
The grass is green where you water it. We are aware of the lack. But we have to align our lives with what God says not with what we think. Psalm 23 shows that God can’t help himself to provide. The story of the samaritan woman - God sometimes is in the midst of discomfort. It’s about us being satisfied with what you have by getting to know God intimately. 

You find out answers by asking questions. 

1. Who am I? 
I am valued.
2. Where am I?
I am adding value.
3. Where am I going?
Value increasing.
4. How do I get there?
I am satisfied.

It’s damaging to not know who you are. If you try to find out who you are by where you are you will always be either inferior or superior to others. 
Our language in church is root language.
