To much is given, much is required.

1. Samuel 16:1-13 (Anointing)
2. Samuel 5:4 (Appointing)

In between anointing and appointment were 20 years.

Over the course of life this is how God develop your destiny and character: A series of processes in every season of life where God forges His image in you.
It is not so much how much we do for Him, but how much like Him we become.
Develop a fully-formed image of Christ in you.
Nothing will kill you faster than the spotlight. Church is not a business it is a family, the family of God.
Don’t worry about anonymity and obscurity. This is where Samuel found David. 
God sees the one who are already in position, being faithful with what they are doing with what they have. You don’t have to market yourself - If God has marked you He will find you.
God doesn’t look at things like we do. The Kingdom is not a democracy, it is a theocracy - God still chooses. 
If your character can’t sustain you, your gift will destroy you.
When nobody is applauding, asking, thanking you - God is observing “I need to know how you will be, react, respond to this”.
You don’t choose what you get anointed for, and also not when you will be appointed.
You have to trust God, enter the house as a servant.
In the wilderness David learned loyalty, self-control, be faithful with a half-kingdom before you get the whole kingdom, turn situations around for the better…
You have to learn what it means for be a servant because you will be a king one day.
Your heart will keep you in your destiny. 
The higher God takes you, the more exposed you will be to attacks from all sides. 
It is not about your self-actualisation but about the people, it is ultimately all about God Himself.
