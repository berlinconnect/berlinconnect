**“For this I was born” by Brian Houston - a book about finding your calling and talents, and aligning them for God’s greater purpose. **

*Written by Stephanie *

This book literally came to me in the most perfect time. I have been asking myself one question quite often lately: Why do I have this talent and how can I use it to give back to Him? But now, after reading this book, I realize that my talent isn’t intended for me to give back to God. It’s actually a gift for me to *receive* from Him, and use it to *give* to others, which in turn will glorify His name. 

This book helped me realize that we are not just saved by His grace, but we are also called.  God purposely and wonderfully made each one of us. We are all created with a specific purpose in mind - His purpose.

You see, I am a singer - a ‘spotlight’ kind of job. It was so easy to get wrapped up in the "me-factor", the competition, and comparison that I lost sight of why exactly I am singing.  Since reading this book, I realized that this gift is uniquely mine. It was a gift from Him to me. What a huge light-bulb moment! Now, every time I sing, whether it is in the practice room or in a performance, I have a sense of humbleness and gratitude for being selected out of literally millions to have this gift. I now have one goal only, to praise Him. I can only do this by fully accepting this gift and its responsibilities and by nourishing it (through practice, magnifying, enlarging, and passing on my knowledge through teaching and helping others). When you nourish it and are faithful to it, He will trust you with more, which often comes in the form of achievements and opportunities. 

*"The cause of Christ will take your vision, your passions, dreams, and goals to levels you could never have imagined."*
