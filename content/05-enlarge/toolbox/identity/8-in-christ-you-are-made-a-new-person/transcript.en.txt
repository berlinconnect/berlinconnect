**2 Corinthians 5:17 J.B. Phillips **
For if a person is in Christ they become a new person altogether - the past is finished and gone, everything has become fresh and new. All this is God’s doing, for he has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ…. 
 
You have become a new person by the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit - the same Holy Spirit that we read about in Genesis 1. The Holy Spirit creates a brand new spirit in you & me, which is alive to God’s presence. 

The finished work of Jesus on the cross made it possible for humanity to live once again in the presence of God. Christianity is not about being religious; no way, it’s about the miracle of a restored relationship with our Heavenly Father. 

Christianity is about you & me doing life with God. In Christ the sin problem that separated us from God has been dealt with by Jesus taking all our sins and giving us His righteousness. 

When you accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior and believed upon Him, you became a new creation in Christ. God's Word tells us that this new man is created in righteousness and true holiness. You have not only become a new person spiritually, but you have become a son/daughter of God.

**PRAYER: **
So meditate on the truth of who you really are in Christ. You are a new person born with godly character; your old nature has been nailed to the cross. Stop focusing on what’s wrong with you and start focusing on what’s right with you because of the work of Jesus at the cross. A Christian needs to remind themselves every day in order to live in the new life that Christ has provided. Enjoy your freedom as you feed on the truth of what Christ has done.
