Once you have surrendered to Christ by choosing to place Jesus at the centre of your life, the Bible teaches us that we are justified before God. The word justified comes from the Greek word dikaioo, which means, “to render“ or to show as just or innocent V free or be righteous. If a person is justified, it means they are made innocent or made just as if they have never sinned 
                
**Galatians 2:16 **
But we know that God accepts only those who have faith in Jesus Christ. No one can please God by simply obeying the Law. So we put our faith in Christ Jesus, and God accepted us because of our faith. (Our trust in what Christ has done for us) 
Who you are before God today and everyday is accepted and justified because of the perfect work of Christ 2000 years ago. Stop looking at your mistakes & failures and start looking at YOUR NEW POSITION you have in Christ – that will cause you to reign in life. You are innocent before God now & forever, now live from that identity.
