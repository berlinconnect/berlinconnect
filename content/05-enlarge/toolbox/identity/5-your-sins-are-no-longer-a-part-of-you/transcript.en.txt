When you believe in what Christ has done for you at the cross and continue to place your faith and trust in Christ everyday, the impact is life transforming. You and I can reign in life with Christ because our position and standing with Jesus is secure now and forever. The fact that we are still capable of sinning does not change our position or identity in Christ. 

God’s kindness and grace does not make you want to sin more, but sin less - God’s kindness lifts us to a whole new level in life. The Bible defines sin as ‘our failure to trust God’s or in other words sin is building our identity on anything else except God. The question is how often do we fail to trust our Jesus? How often do we build our identity on things other than God? 

The good news is that Christ has dealt with the sin issue once and forever, our part is to keep walking in the truth of who we are in Christ, our new identity. When you fail to trust God, when you sin, your job is to acknowledge that you are forgiven and to speak God's truth over your life, remind yourself that you are righteous before Christ. That’s where the power of God starts and the Holy Spirit begins to work in a beautiful way. The truth is that your sins have not simply been covered but actually removed from your account - past, present and future. 
 
**Matthew 26:26-28 CEV **
During the meal Jesus took some bread in his hands. He blessed the bread and broke it. Then he gave it to his disciples and said, “Take this and eat it. This is my body.” 27 Jesus picked up a cup of wine and gave thanks to God. He then gave it to his disciples and said, “Take this and drink it. 28 This represents my blood shed for you, and with it God makes his agreement with you. It will be poured out, so that many people will have their sins forgiven.” 
 
And if forgiving us wasn't enough, God Himself chose to forget our failures for His own sake. When He sees us, He doesn't want to remember our failures, His desire is that we see ourselves as His precious children who stand blameless before Him.
