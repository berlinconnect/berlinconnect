Text: In John 8:32 Jesus says ‘You will know the truth and the truth will set you free.’ (NLT)

The word know means to be intimate with. When you are in a close relationship with Christ Jesus, you learn so much about His love for you and His faithful character towards you. This intimacy leads to knowing the truth in a way that you experience freedom and joy in your everyday life as a believer. Knowing God’s truth is the key to live in freedom.

In Romans 5: 8, Paul explains that you are loved by God not because of what you’ve done but because of what Christ has done.
God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners. (NLT)

When you know your true identity in life, you can live refusing to accept the lies that contradict what your heavenly Father says about you. Because of the finished work of Christ on the cross 2000 years ago, God is no longer distant from you. Every day of your life on planet earth can be lived powerfully as you believe and put your faith in Jesus.

I encourage you to say to yourself everyday, "I am worthy because JESUS' blood has
made me worthy "
