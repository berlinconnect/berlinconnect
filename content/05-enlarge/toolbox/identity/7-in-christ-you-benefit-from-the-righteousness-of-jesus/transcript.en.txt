Imagine you’re stranded somewhere in the wilderness, it’s cold and dark. You have no 
resources, no wood, no matches, nothing…. suddenly you see a fire in the distance, you run towards it and as you get closer you see a man, you freeze as you’re not sure if the man is friendly. The man notices you and smiles, he moves his head to indicate come over by the fire and get warm. Your heart is pumping, but at the same time you’re so relieved because you know that without the warmth of the fire you will freeze to death 
 
You did nothing to start the fire, you didn’t collect any of the wood, you didn’t do any of the work to get the fire going but here you are benefiting from the kindness of the man who freely invites you into the warmth of the fire. This is a similar picture of what Christ has done for you and me, however, the real truth is even stronger.
 
Christ took our place in the cold and we took His place by the fire. He took our sin and wrongdoing and we received His right standing with The Father. This is called the Great Exchange. God did all the work. He initiated the whole thing and He came after us. When you settle in your heart and mind who you really are in Christ you begin to see your Christian life flourish in ways you could never imagine.

God’s kindness and grace does not mean we have a license to keep sinning, no way V God’s kindness and grace make it possible for us to sin less. We get better with kindness and grace, not worse. Live as a son/daughter of Grace not as a slave to sin. 
Live from peace not for peace. 

**PRAYER**: 
Thank You, Father, for the abundance of Your Grace. Thank You for the free gift of right standing with You. Thank You that now I can live from this great exchange and that nothing will ever be able to seperate me from Your love. Thank You that I don’t need to struggle for peace, but that I can live from the peace You give me.
