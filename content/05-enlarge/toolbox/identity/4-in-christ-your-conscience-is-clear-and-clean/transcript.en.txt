Since our sins have been put on Christ and removed from us and since we are justified (made right with God) you and I are entitled to a clean and undefiled conscience. 
 
**Hebrews 9:14 NLT ****Bold text**
Just think how much more the blood of Christ will purify our consciences from sinful deeds so that we can worship the living God. For by the power of the eternal Spirit, Christ offered himself to God as a perfect sacrifice for our sins. 
                
**Psalm 103:8-14 NLT **
The Lord is compassionate and merciful, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love. 9 He will not constantly accuse us, nor remain angry forever. 10 He does not punish us for all our sins; he does not deal harshly with us, as we deserve. 11 For his unfailing love toward those who fear him is as great as the height of the heavens above the earth. 12 He has removed our sins as far from us as the east is from the west. 13 The Lord is like a father to his children, tender and compassionate to those who fear him. 14 For he knows how weak we are. 
                
My friend, if you are still beating yourself up over your past failures which have been nailed to the cross, you are denying the work that Christ has done for you A clean conscience before the Lord agrees with what Christ has done in removing our sin and declaring us justified and innocent before the Lord. 
 
Live as a son/daughter of Grace, not as a slave to sin.
