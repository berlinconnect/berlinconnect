KEY POINTS:
1. Vision will always be fulfilled through relationship.
2. The heartbeat of heaven is to know Him and to make Him known.
3. We have the opportunity to take what God has given us and move it forward.
4. The closer the relationship to the owner (see Matthew 25) the less details you need to know to use the gifts God gave you and work towards the objective.

KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:
Isaiah 54:2 NCV
Make your tent bigger; stretch it out and make it wider.
Do not hold back. Make the ropes longer and its stakes stronger.

Matthew 25:14-30 ESV
“For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. 15 To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. 16 He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. 17 So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. 18 But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. 19 Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 20 And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.’ 21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 22 And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.’ 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 24 He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, 25 so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’ 26 But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? 27 Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. 28 So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. 29 For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.

Observations:
- All were given the same things: Objective - Gift - Opportunity
- Objective: Knowing the Father and making Him known
- Gift: The owner gave according to their ability and according to their relationship.
- Opportunity: The owner didn’t tell them exactly what they should do nor did he give them a timeframe. But when you have a relationship with the owner you understand what it is he wants from you. 

What will enlarge your life?
1. Purpose: A divinely implanted sense of purpose (Ecc 3:11) will always make you stand out.
2. Vision (Hab 2:2)
3. The cause of Christ 
4. Serving (example: Jesus)
5. Excellence (example: Daniel)
6. Submission (example: Jesus)
7. Generosity: Adding value.

CONCLUSION:
We have the opportunity to make what God put in our life better and to take it forward. Not knowing the details didn't stop the first two servants from moving forward. They had a trust relationship with their owner.

THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:
The way you see God and yourself affects the way God can move in and through your life. Matthew 25 encourages us to follow the example of the first two servants and not the third who allowed fear and a wrong image of the owner cause him to bury his talent. Don't bury your gift, bury your fear. Your relationship with Jesus is crucial in seeing the vision fulfilled.
