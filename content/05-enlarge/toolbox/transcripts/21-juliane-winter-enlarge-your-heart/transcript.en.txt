**KEY POINTS:**
1. Enlarging your life starts with your heart. 
2. Learn to trust.
3. Choose servanthood.
4. Receive amazing grace.  
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
**Isaiah 54:2**
Enlarge the place of your tent, stretch your tent curtains wide, do not hold back; lengthen your cords, strengthen your stakes.
<br>
Enlarging your life starts with your heart. 
Everything you see on the outside, has its root on the inside. 

It’s about enlarging our lives to have more room for the people that God will still add to the House of God. It’s not about making my life bigger, but making my life bigger with a purpose: to have more room for the people. 
<br>
**Proverbs 4:23 **
Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it. 
<br>
**1. Learn to trust **
Covering our hearts is the opposite of enlarging. Having walls built around you makes your heart smaller. Our hearts get stronger in a relationship with God. 
<br>
**2. Choose servanthood**
**Mark 10:45**
Jesus came to serve, not to be served

Choose a spirit of servanthood, before you even know what exactly you will do. 
Servanthood is not a job, but an identity. 
Choose to let go of preference, before using the opportunity to say ‘no’. 
<br>
**3. Receive amazing grace**
Receiving grace and forgiveness will enlarge your heart because through that freedom will come to your heart. 

**Romans 8:1**
Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
How do we learn to trust, choose servanthood, and receive amazing grace? It comes down to knowing our identity. Knowing our Saviour Jesus Christ and believing that He is on our side. 
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
What areas in my life have I not yet received amazing grace? How would my life be different if I really started to grasp what it means to live with no condemnation?
