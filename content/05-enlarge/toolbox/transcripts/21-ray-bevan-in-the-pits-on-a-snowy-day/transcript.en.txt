**KEY POINTS:**
1. Facing your greatest fear in your weakest moment will produce your greatest strength.
2. God wants to release your potential as you “face your lions”.
3. God recognizes, honours, empowers, and encourages you to overcome your fears. 
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:
1 Chronicles 11: 22-25 NKJV**
Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. He had killed two lion-like heroes of Moab. **He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day**. 23 And he killed an Egyptian, a man of great height, five cubits tall. In the Egyptian’s hand there was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear. 24 These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among three mighty men. 25 Indeed he was more honored than the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three. And David appointed him over his guard.

**What “lion” is roaring at you? What fear are you facing? **
Facing your greatest fear is like “fighting a lion in a snowy pit”. King David recognized Benaiah. The same way, Jesus recognizes and honors you overcoming your fear; be it rebuilding your life, conquering hopelessness… 

**Out of your greatest fear, your greatest strength can arise. **
You would have never heard of David if it wasn’t for Goliath. Through Goliath David’s greatest potential was released. 

**Potential: Power, quality, principle that exists, but has never been developed, used, or released. → In order for your potential to be released, it needs to be placed in the right environment.**
To see light give it darkness. 
To see love, give it betrayal.
To see real faith, give it fear.
To see peace, give it a storm.
To see hope, give it pain.
To see courage, give it a Goliath. 
To see the call of God, give it a Pharaoh to oppose it.
To see real love, give it a cross to kill it.
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
**Don’t despise the negative. In the negative lies supernatural power to release your potential. **
Batteries work when the positive is aligned with the negative. Your ‘negative’ aligned with Jesus - the ‘positive’ - will bring you life. 
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
What “lion” are you facing? 
How you react to the negative, will change people’s perception of Jesus.
