**KEY POINTS: **
1. Tithing is a principle established long before the law was given to God’s people in the Old Testament.
2. Jesus is the recipient of the tithe (Hebrews 7:8).
3. The purpose of the tithe is not to get rich but to show how great God is.
4. Tithing breaks the root of all evil (which is the love of money).
5. The Lord doesn’t need your tithe as much as you need His disproportionate blessing which is the outcome of the tithe.

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
**Genesis 14:17-24**
17 After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).
18 Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, 19 and he blessed Abram, saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. 20 And praise be to God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything. 21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself.” 22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “With raised hand I have sworn an oath to the Lord, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, 23 that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram rich.’ 24 I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me—to Aner, Eshkol and Mamre. Let them have their share.”
<br>
**Hebrews 7:1-17**
This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him, 2 and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, the name Melchizedek means “king of righteousness”; then also, “king of Salem” means “king of peace.” 3 Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.
4 Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder! 5 Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people—that is, from their fellow Israelites—even though they also are descended from Abraham. 6 This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. 7 And without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater. 8 In the one case, the tenth is collected by people who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living. 9 One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham, 10 because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.
11 If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood—why was there still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron? 12 For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also. 13 He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.14 For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests. 15 And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears, 16 one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life. 17 For it is declared: “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”

**Jesus, high priest in the order of Melchizedek**
Melchi = King, Zedek = Righteousness 
Melchizedek was the king of a city called ‘Shalom’ which means health, wholeness, and well-being. 

Jesus is not a high priest after the order of Levi - a priesthood under the law - but after the order of Melchizedek - a priesthood under grace. Melchizedek came to Abraham with blessings and in the same way, Jesus also comes full of grace saying: “Blessed are you!” 
<br>
**Abraham tithed **
Abraham tithed even before the law was given to Moses years later. He didn’t tithe out of a feeling of obligation, but out of a revelation. In the same way, we are the daughters and sons of Abraham, we don’t give out of obligation, but spontaneously, out of a revelation and a changed heart. We are sons of Abraham - coming up under a priesthood of grace and not a levitical priesthood under the law. 
<br>
**Generational blessing**
The blessing that comes through the tithe impacts not only you in the present moment, but is a generational one.
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
**2 Corinthians 9:6**
Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.

The Lord doesn’t need your tithe as much as you need His disproportionate blessing that is the outcome of the tithe.
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
Don’t tithe out of a feeling of obligation, but out of a conviction of your heart. God doesn’t need your tithe and His love for you is not dependent on your tithe. It is truly unconditional. Nevertheless, tithing is a God-principle. When you give 10%, He blesses the 90%.
