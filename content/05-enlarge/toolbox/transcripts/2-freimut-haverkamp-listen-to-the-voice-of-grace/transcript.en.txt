**KEY POINTS:**
1. God doesn’t want you to stay in the past, He wants you to walk into your God given future.
2. Don’t worry about what is going to happen in the future, God has got you covered. 
3. Let the loudest voice in your life be the voice of God, the voice of grace!
<br>

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **
**1 Corinthians 15:9-10 (NLT)**
9 For I am the least of all the apostles. In fact, I’m not even worthy to be called an apostle after the way I persecuted God’s church.
10 **But** whatever I am now, it is all because God poured out his special favor on me—and not without results. For I have worked harder than any of the other apostles; yet it was not I but God who was working through me by his grace. 
<br>
**What voice are you listening to?**
There are things that have a voice in your life such as your family, your money, your job. And sometimes it is really hard to identify which voice you should be listening to. And sometimes the voice that is the loudest, is not necessarily the one you should be listening to. Do you know what God is saying in your life? Can you hear His voice? Are you listening to His voice amongst all other voices? 
<br>
**Voices in your life**
1. The voice of the past - reminds you of your mistakes and brings shame and guilt.
2. The voice of the future - sows fear and doubt. 
3. The voice of others - brings uncertainty and fear of criticism. 
4. The voice of Grace - the one true voice of God. 
<br>
**God doesn’t want you to stay in the past, He wants you to walk into your God given future**
Do you hear the voice of God telling you that you are forgiven and saved by grace? Or are you listening to the voice of the past reminding you of all your failures, reminding you of all your faults and your shame? Or are you making a choice to listen to God’s voice? God has saved you and He wants you to walk. He doesn’t want you to stay in the past, He wants you to walk into your future!
<br>
**Don’t worry about what is going to happen, God has got you covered**
Are you worried about your future? Do you listen to the voice of uncertainty and the voice of doubt? The negative “what if” voice? What if something goes wrong in your life? But have you ever considered the postitive “what if” voice? What if God shows up? What if God works on your behalf? Don’t worry about what is going to happen. God has got you covered. 
<br>
**Let the loudest voice in your life be the voice of God: the voice of Grace**
Do you worry about what others are thinking and saying about you? Just imagine if you just didn’t care what others think and say about you. Just imagine that you only believed God’s voice. The voice that says you are saved, that you are loved. Not perfect, but that by the grace of God you can face any obstacle in your life. Just imagine that you only listened to the voice of God telling you that He will never leave you or forsake you. Because no matter what others say, God is with you. And if God is for you, who can be against you?
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
Do not let all the voices around you define who you are. You may have a past and you might have faults. But guilt and shame do not define who you are. God defines us! Do not let the fear about your future or the voices of others define who you are! Instead listen to what Jesus says about you and your life and be defined by what He says about you! Listen to the voice of grace that tells you that you try again. After each failure, after each fall - try again!
