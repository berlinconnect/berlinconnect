Text: Leadership is placing value, speaking to potential and pointing to vision.

But how can you place value, speak to potential and point to vision in someone else’s life if you don’t place value, speak to potential or point to vision in your own life?

Captains/Leaders aren’t always the best players but they bring out the best in all the others players/people.

Leadership starts on the inside of you. You don’t have to be “at the top” to start leading. Anyone in any position can lead. We shouldn’t define our importance by our position. We are already important despite our position.

Leadership is all throughout the bible. Jesus never stops leading us. Will we continue to follow Him?

When you build a healthy church or start a business etc. there are three things you need: Vision, Strategy and Culture. Having these three things give God something to work with.

Part of the vision of our Church is to raise up leaders for every area of society. What’s the vision? Three and a half million reasons in our city. Open your eyes to the God given opportunity that lies in front of us. Vision is easy.

Strategy is easy. What is strategy? Common sense. E.g. I need to get from point A to B.

Culture is something you align and connect your life with, then, you become the culture. If you’re connected and aligned to the culture a welcoming atmosphere is created for people.

Culture is something you share with others, it’s something that unites us.

Humility is I know who I am and I know who God is. 
Let the culture of our church be defined by Psalm 23. 

Overflow is the byproduct of being connected to something, it’s a fruit. It comes from alignement.

When you align yourself to who you are in christ, the overflow comes.

Overflow comes out alignment.
Alignment comes from submission. 
Submission comes out of surrender
Surrender comes out of letting go of control.
Pride can never let go of control but humility can.

Pride is married to arrogance
Humility is married to confidence

Humility loves, builds, believes the best and lifts others. It doesn’t need to brag or boast because they know who they are. But arrogance tears others down, it points out faults, it exalts itself.

Our beliefs and our values will set our future - they define our culture. Let’s be the culture. More culture can be shared by over dinner than by many events. It’s something that is caught not taught.

Blessed are the flexible. Your life will be defined by your flexibility. Humility is always flexible. 

Don’t make things an issue, don’t major on it. Nothing is a problem. Everything is easy.

We know there are problems in life but we choose to have an attitude that says nothing is a problem.

Of course things are not always easy, but it’s about the decision you make. God supplies when you make a commitment. 

We underestimate the power of culture. It trumps vision and strategy every time and what will define us as a church is our culture.
