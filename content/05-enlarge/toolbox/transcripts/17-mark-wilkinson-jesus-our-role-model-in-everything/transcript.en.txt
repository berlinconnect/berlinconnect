**KEY POINTS:**
1. Let Jesus be the role model in everything.
2. Taking on the attitude of a servant will cause you to stand out.
3. Don't try to be the best, work on bringing out the best in others - help others succeed.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
**Philippians 2:2 (VOICE)**
If you find any comfort from being **united with Christ**, if His love brings you any encouragement, if you experience true companionship with the Spirit, if His tenderness and mercy fill your heart; then, brothers and sisters, 2 here is one thing that would complete my joy—**come together as one in mind and spirit and purpose, sharing in the same love**. 3 Don’t let selfishness and **PRIDEFUL** agendas take over. Embrace true humility, and lift your heads to extend love to others. 4 Get beyond yourselves and protecting your own interests; be sincere, and secure your neighbors’ interests first. 5 **In other words, [when it comes to relationships with each other] adopt the mindset of Jesus! Live with His attitude in your hearts**. Remember:
6 Though He was the **exact likeness** of God, He chose not to cling to equality with God; 7 But He poured Himself out to fill a vessel brand new; a servant in form and a man indeed. The very likeness of humanity, 8 He humbled Himself, obedient to death—a merciless death on the cross! 9 So God raised Him up to the highest place and gave Him the name above all. 10  So when His name is called, every knee will bow, in heaven, on earth, and below. 11  And every tongue will confess “Jesus, the Anointed One, is Lord,”  to the glory of God our Father!
<br>
**MATTHEW 5:13 (MSG)**
**Salt and Light**
“Let me tell you why you are here. You’re here to be salt-seasoning that brings out the God-flavors of this earth. If you lose your saltiness, how will people taste godliness? You’ve lost your usefulness and will end up in the garbage.
14-16 “Here’s another way to put it: You’re here to be light, bringing out the God-colors in the world. God is not a secret to be kept. We’re going public with this, as public as a city on a hill. If I make you light-bearers, you don’t think I’m going to hide you under a bucket, do you? I’m putting you on a light stand. Now that I’ve put you there on a hilltop, on a light stand—**SHINE**! Keep open house; be generous with your lives. By opening up to others, you’ll prompt people to open up with God, this generous Father in heaven.
<br>
**Let Jesus be the role model in everything**
-You need a role model to be a role model!
-When Jesus is the centre, other people are the focus. 
-Start seeing people the way God sees them.
<br>
**Use your success to see others succeed**
-No matter where you are at, in God’s eyes you are always successful.
-Use your success to see others succeed. Be a role model to others.
-To be a role model, you need to know the greatest role model of all.
-It is not hard to stand out - just let God be God in your life and you will always stand out!
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
When it comes to relationships, adopt the mindset of Jesus. Love others with His attitude in your heart!
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
What can you do to put the focus on other people and add value to their lives? Don’t just focus on those who seem ‘lovable’ but on those who are disregarded by society (See also Luke 10:25-37).
