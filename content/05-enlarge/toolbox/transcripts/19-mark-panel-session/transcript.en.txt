Text: Marriage and family are God’s ideas. Let’s not take God’s concept and make them into something they were never supposed to be.
 
Timothy Keller’s Every Good Endeavor: Every work can be done to God’s glory.
 
How can we serve God within work?
 
Your work is not without purpose. When you make work your identity, it gets difficult. When you have success it gets to your head- and when you don’t have success, it will go to your heart. Idols are not necessarily bad unless you are turning it into an ultimate thing.

Gods feeds us through people (farmers, drivers, grocery shop managers, etc.) – therefore every little task is actually Gods work. Every work has dignity!
 
There is nothing wrong with wealth – but if it gets something that drives you, it gets complicated. Work should be a calling to serve a greater good.
 
A lot of people see serving God only on platform in Church or in a team – but it can be so much more. Everyone has a different platform. God gives you your own platform. In the business world for example it is very powerful to serve God and show other people the love of God through your actions.
 
You learn a lot of Kingdom values in church (excellence, leadership, generosity…) – and you can immediately implement them in your career to make a difference. Generosity or excellence for example make a big difference in the business world because you know its all about people, its all about the one.
 
We are not going to church, we are the church. So if we go to work, our colleagues or customers meet the church all the time – it changes the way why we work because we then know its not about the task but its about the people behind it. You can change the atmosphere at your work place. Being a part of the house helps to be better at your job.
 
As an artist God gives you all the freedom to create. It’s really important to not only focus on your skill but also on your character. At the university it often is all about you and yourself, it’s quite an individualistic and competitive culture. The community mindset is what you learn in God’s house and that’s what holds all the freedom.
 
Climbing the career latter all by yourself can be really tiring. It’s way more fun to make it all about people and help others to get further on their career ways. If you rest in God and his love for you you don’t need to strive anymore.
 
It’s important to know that you are one person. Changing identity or persona in  different areas of life is unhealthy. Being true to yourself and the kingdom values you hold is the key to a balanced life.
