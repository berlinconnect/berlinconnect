**KEY POINTS: **
1. Beginnings are vulnerable. Yet, there is a treasure in small beginnings that you don’t see it if you despise the vulnerability, isolation, and frustation that comes with them. 
2. The adversity of small beginnings is what helps you discover your personality. 
3. Your beginnings are already impregnated with your endings. Everything you are supposed to become is fixed in your small beginnings.

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **
**Zech 4:10 NLT**
Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin.

**Small beginnings**
God said: Whatever you do, don’t despise small beginnings! 
God knows there’s a treasure in small beginnings that we fail to see if we’re despising them.
Beginnings are brutal, isolated, lonely, full of pressure. But they are precious to the development of your person.

**The “Alpha” and “Omega” **
God has your future in mind, even at your small beginning. He is the “Alpha” and the “Omega” at exactly the same time. 
Your beginnings are already impregnated with your endings. Everything you are supposed to become is in your small beginnings already. 

**King David’s small beginnings (see 1 Samuel 2:17)**
David had a small beginning, looking after sheep; not knowing what the outcome and impact of his life would be, one day. 
In his early days in the wilderness - his “Alpha” days - boring, isolated, excluded, rejected days, he developed skills, he didn’t know he would be used by God. 
When he stood before Goliath all of that “Alpha” came into his “Omega” moment and his life changed forever. 

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
Send somebody an encouraging text who is going through a small beginning. 
What is your personal small beginning? Step out and have the courage to tell someone about it.
