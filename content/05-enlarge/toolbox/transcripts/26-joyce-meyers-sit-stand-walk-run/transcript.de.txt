**KEY POINTS:**
1. Rest and peace are the conditions to enjoy life.
2. Know that you can rest in God’s eternal love and forgiveness, being seated next with Him.
3. If you fall, if you are tired, remember that nothing is accomplished unless you do it from a place of rest being seated with Christ.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
<br>
**Ephesians 1:19 NKJV**
17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, 18 the eyes of your understanding[c] being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power 20 which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead **and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places**.
<br>
**Hebrews 1:3 NLT**
3 The Son radiates God’s own glory and expresses the very character of God, and he sustains everything by the mighty power of his command. **When he had cleansed us from our sins, he sat down in the place of honor at the right hand of the majestic God** in heaven.
<br>
**Hebrews 1:13 NLT**
13 And God never said to any of the angels, “**Sit in the place of honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies, making them a footstool under your feet**.”
<br>
**Ephesians 2:6 NLT**
6 For he raised us from the dead along with Christ and **seated us with him in the heavenly realms** because we are united with Christ Jesus.
<br>
**Rest and peace are the conditions to enjoy life.**
Without rest and peace there is no joy in your life. But when Jesus talks about enjoying life, He doesn’t mean holidays - He wants you to be able to enjoy everyday life. You can only enjoy life if you know how to rest. While you are doing things of everyday life, you can have the confidence and peace of knowing that Jesus has already completed everything by dying on the cross for us. 
<br>
**Sit. Stand. Walk. And then Run.**
Christ picks us up and seats us up in heavenly places with Him. Only after we learn how to sit, can we stand - and only after we learn how to stand, can we walk, and only then can we take off and run for everything God has for us. While God wants everything for us, it has to come in a certain order. The bible tells us, to sit, to stand, to walk and to run - when we are standing, we are standing strong against the enemy. But we need to fight the enemy from the standpoint that God has already done everything for us. In order to fight standing against the enemy, you need to be seated spiritually besides God. 
<br>
**If you fall, rest in the confidence and peace of knowing that Jesus loves you**
When you are in a situation where you feel like no one likes you - you can rest in knowing that God does not only like you, He loves you. Whenever you feel pressured, come to Jesus and rest in Him. We cannot walk in Christ if we don’t know how to rest in Him. After all walking consists of steps, and every step requires a decision - a decision to rest in Him. Sometimes we are being attacked, having to stand against the enemy. Sometimes we might even fall. Anytime you fall, you cannot stand again unless you go back to sitting first. When you sin, rest in Him and His forgiveness. 
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
We have to stand against the enemy all the time. But all we have to know in order to stand tall is how to be seated next to Christ. If you know peace, you know power. Learn the power that is available to you in Christ. When you are saved, God has forgiven all your sins - past, present and future! Your behaviour is not going to make Him love you more than He already does!
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
Do you feel frustrated, do you feel guilty, do you feel tired? Draw on the authority and power that God has given you over your circumstances, rest in Him knowing that nothing can come against you. 
**Luke 10:19 NLT** “Look, I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy, and you can walk among snakes and scorpions and crush them. Nothing will injure you.”
