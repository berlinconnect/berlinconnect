**KEY POINTS:**
1. We are created in three parts - all acting individually - spirit, soul, and body. 
2. Letting ourselves be lead by our soul or body will not help us live a healthy life.
3. Instead, being lead by the spirit that lives in us through Jesus Christ will help guide our steps. 
4. The Spirit knows the truth, therefore the actions lead by it speak only of the truth. 
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **

**1 Thessalonians 5:23 (NLV)**
23 May the God of peace set you apart for Himself. May every part of you be set apart for God. May your spirit and your soul and your body be kept complete. May you be without blame when our Lord Jesus Christ comes again.
We are created in three parts - all acting individually - spirit, soul, and body.
**1. IMAGE** This is the part of the body which is consumed with outward appearance. Not only our physical beauty or body, but also concerned about what others think of us. Therefore we act a certain way to ‘fit in.’ Image tries to earn salvation, by tracking church attendance, deeds, tithes, etc…

Question: Does your image reflect you, or someone who you are trying to be? Are you trying to look like a “good Christian" to feel saved?
<br>
**2. SOUL: **This is a dominant part of us as it leads us in our daily life. The Bible uses Heart and Soul interchangeably, meaning mind, will, and emotion. The Soul needs to feel constantly saved as it’s always about its own salvation vs. the salvation of others. 

**Proverbs 4:23 (NLV) **
23 Keep your heart pure for out of it flow the important things of life.

Question:  Life leads you to your most prominent thought, therefore be careful what you think about. Are you constantly lead by emotions? Are you asking others what they think of you, when instead you should be asking God what He says about you? Subject all your thoughts to the Father.
<br>
**3. SPIRIT** The Bible tells us that when we were born, we were born in body and soul, but our spirit was dead. It was the moment that we met Christ, our salvation, that our Spirit was awakened. This is the part of us that knows the truth. When we allow ourselves to be Spirit lead, vs Body or Soul lead, we are submitting ourselves fully to what Christ has for us.

**Romans 8:37 (NLV) **
37 In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

Question: Are you allowing your actions and worries to be dominated by your body or soul rather than what by your Spirit? If you are lead by the spirit, you can conquer all mountains in your way.
<br>
**Galatians 5:17-18 (NIV)**
17 For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want.18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
As Christians, there is always a constant battle between the body, soul, and Spirit. However, when we allow ourselves to be Spirit lead, we are lead into triumph as we no longer give into temptations and compromise.
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
What areas of your life are you still trying to control and hold on to (Body and Soul lead) ? Can you step back and allow God to come in and lead you through these areas of your life (Spirit lead)? You can conquer excuses and compromises and be lead into triumph.
