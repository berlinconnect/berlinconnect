Text: The bible is the word of God. It is not an inspirational writing and it offers His solution for every possible situation in our lives.
 
James 1:22 -24
 
The word of God acts like a mirror. It reveals to you who God is, who you are and where you are at. You cannot get where you want to be without knowing where you are at the present moment. Looking into the bible is like looking into the eyes of God.
 
Take time to look into the mirror to discover who you really are. And do not be forgetful. Find out what the word of God has to say about you and then know it and know yourself from that day onwards.
 
We see our own image reflected in the Word. Important is to keep that image with us and remember it in times where we feel that our present reality is so much different from what we have seen. The act of continuing keeps us blessed. Being a forgetful hearer is like being married but acting like a single person.
 
When you start looking at things from God perspective, you can see challenges in perspective. You will be blessed in all you do, not only in church life.
 
Matthew 7,25
 
If you are true the Word, then you will withstand the storms of life.
 
Joshua 1
 
We will prosper and push forward in our careers, families, neighborhoods and all our relationships.
 
Jeremiah 7:23
 
Everything else is temporal. People and circumstances change but Jesus will be the same always.
 
Ephesians
 
Before the foundations of the world were laid God has called you out.  He has made sure that if you stay on His path you will become everything he wishes you to be.
 
What you place in the center of your attention determines how you think and act. So meditate on the word of God day and night. If you want to succeed in life you have to be a doer.
