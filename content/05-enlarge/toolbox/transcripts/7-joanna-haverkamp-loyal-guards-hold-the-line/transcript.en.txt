<br>

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **
**Proverbs 4:23 (NIV)**
Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.
<br>
**We guard something properly when we know its value**
Everything you do flows out of your heart. Your heart is important, which is why the instruction is “guard it”. But you will only guard something properly, if you are fully aware of its value! We guard what is valuable. But what is valuable to you? The bible tells us that nothing is more valuable than our heart, which is why we are instructed to guard our heart more than anything else.
<br>
**Proverbs 4:20-27 (NIV)**
My son, pay attention to what I say; turn your **ear** to my words.
21 Do not let them out of your **sight**, keep them within your **heart**;
22 for they are life to those who find them and health to one’s whole body.
23 **Above all else, guard your heart**,  for everything you do flows from it.
24 Keep your **mouth** free of perversity; keep corrupt **talk** far from your **lips**.
25 Let your **eyes** look straight ahead; fix your **gaze** directly before you.
26 Give careful **thought** to the paths for your **feet** and be steadfast in all your ways.
27 Do not turn to the right or the left; keep your **foot** from evil.
<br>
**Your heart is guarded as long as your guards stay loyal**
Proverbs 4:20-27 tells us the guards that we have been given. Many just treat them as body parts, when they are actually more than that - they have been given to us as guards. Ears, mind, mouth, eyes and feet all given to guard what is most precious! Our heart is protected as long as our guards stay loyal. But the moment one of the guards on duty leaves his post, our heart is no longer protected. 
<br>
**Our heart is our responsibility**
If one of our guards is not working in unity to protect what is most precisous there is a hole in the line of protection. When one of your guards is tempted to wander, tell yourself “Hold the line”. Only a united front is strong! It leaves no gap for the enemy to break through. We need to have loyal guards who will hold the line. Make no mistake, we are in a battle and the enemy would love to take you out! And the enemy will aim at your heart 100% of the time. But if your guards hold the line, the enemy will not, shall not and cannot get through.
<br>
**How can we equip ourselves to hold the line?**
- Guards are placed at entrances and exists for good reason! Ears and eyes - they are guards placed at the entrances to our soul. If they are loyal, they will only get the good stuff in and they will kep the bad stuff out!
- Guards ensure a safe distance between what needs protecting and any possible threat. Mind, ears, feat - a loyal guard will not allow anything or anyone to come too close.
- Guards are trained and have the weapons they need to do the job. Guards are not helpless. Neither are you. 
<br>

**CONCLUSION:**
Our lives are full of habits. Good ones and bad ones. Lets train our guards to have good habits. Allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you, you need to train your guards. And you need to pick up your weapon - the Word of God is sharpen than any two edged sword! We have these guards, how crazy are we to not empower them with the weapon they need!

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
Understand the value of your heart. Remember that everything else flows out of it, so protect it well - think about how you can hold the line
