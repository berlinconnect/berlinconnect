**Luke 23:44-49 NLT - The Death of Jesus **
44 By this time it was noon, and darkness fell across the whole land until three o’clock. 45 The light from the sun was gone. And suddenly, the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn down the middle. 46 Then Jesus shouted, “Father, I entrust my spirit into your hands!” – “it is finished” and with those words he breathed no more. 47 When the Roman officer overseeing the execution saw what had happened, he worshiped God and said, “Surely this man was innocent.” 48 And when the entire crowd that came to see the crucifixion saw what had happened, they went home heartbroken and in deep sorrow. 49 But Jesus’ friends, including the **WOMEN** who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching. 
<br>
**Luke 23:50-56 NLT - The Burial of Jesus **
50 Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph. He was a member of the Jewish high council, 51 but he had not agreed with the decision and actions of the other religious leaders. He was from the town of Arimathea in Judea, and he was waiting for the Kingdom of God to come. 52 He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. 53 Then he took the body down from the cross and wrapped it in a long sheet of linen cloth and laid it in a new tomb that had been carved out of rock. 54 This was done late on Friday afternoon, the day of preparation, as the Sabbath was about to begin. 55 As his body was taken away, the **WOMEN** from Galilee followed and saw the tomb where his body was placed. 56 Then they went home and prepared spices and ointments to anoint his body. But by the time they were finished the Sabbath had begun, so they rested as required by the law.
<br>
**Luke 24:1-9 NLT - The Resurrection **
1 But very early on Sunday morning the **WOMEN** went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. 2 They found that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance. 3 So they went in, but they didn’t find the body of the Lord Jesus. 4 As they stood there puzzled, two men suddenly appeared to them, clothed in dazzling robes. 5 The women were terrified and bowed with their faces to the ground. Then the men asked, “Why are you looking among the dead for someone who is alive? 6 He isn’t here! He is risen from the dead! Remember what he told you back in Galilee, 7 that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and that he would rise again on the third day.” 8 Then they remembered that he had said this. 9 So they rushed back from the tomb to tell his eleven disciples—and everyone else—what had happened.
<br>
**The Women **
Women were not taken seriously in those days, not taken into account as legal witnesses, they were simply overlooked. If you needed to convince people, you wouldn’t put women into this story. But God doesn’t need a man-made system or society to lend him credibility. God doesn’t need all the scientists, all the intellectuals to confirm that He is God. 
Mary Magdalene was the first to meet Jesus after the resurrection. A woman scorned by society. Mary Magdalene was a mess, but her story was turned into a message through the grace of God. 

**CONCLUSION:**
Women in the New Testament often point towards the Church. The Church is testifying to the fact that Jesus is alive.
