Text: IDENTITY – finding out who we are in Christ.
 
You always follow someone or something. What are you following?
 
Ephesians 6:20 NLT
 
Paul refers to himself as an ambassador, even though he is in prison. He does not allow where he is do determine who he is.
 
**WHERE YOU ARE DOES NOT DEFINE WHO YOU ARE.**

Just like for Paul, who you are is not determined by where you are in life. Still, we often allow our career, our degrees, our material possessions or our private pursuits to define who we are. If we fail at something, we tend to take it on as an identity and think we are a failure ourselves.
 
But when you know who He is, you will discover who you really are. God does not see your failures when he looks at you, but he sees the righteousness of Jesus.
 
Acts 2 
 
All the believers devoted themselves. Devotion is a strong commitment: you are not making time in your life, you are making room and opening yourself up.
 
Out of devotion comes right identity. Right identity allows you to encourage people and place value on them.
 
Devotion also includes a heart connection, an intimate relationship with the real deal, not just the image. If you really know who you are, you can start expecting less from others and more from yourself. You will not try to expect other people to give you what only He can give you: complete acceptance.
 
We are always afraid of rejection in our relationships. But God says: you are accepted and you fit right with me.
 
Devotion is really a fruit of knowing Jesus. You cannot make people devotional. It is an overflow. If you make room in your life for Him and other people, it is not going be about budgeting or being stingy with your time. When you follow Jesus, you develop the capacity to be an example worth following for others.
 
Paul says: I am in prison because of who I am, which is an ambassador of Jesus Christ. If you are an ambassador of Christ, you will not fall into the inner turmoil that comes from being dependent on your circumstances for your identity.
 
In our lives, we can fall into the temptation of seeing ourselves as superior or inferior than our neighbor in our lives and it can hurt you and others. You are going to be too hard on yourself or seek things that are bad for you if you feel inferior. Even if you are successful and you feel superior, your identity will be based on something fragile.
 
So do not wait to ask yourself who you really are and act from who you are in Christ.
Some practical things on how to be a good follower:
 
Hebrews 13,17
We don’t want to make it hard for Jesus to lead me.
But if we are not confident in our identity, we get insecure and defensive -and by that we are restricting people to help us moving forward.
 
There are some practical things you can nourish to be a good follower, get your identity right and prepare to be a great leader:

**SHARED BELIEF:**
You got to believe in what we are doing as a Church.
> we want to build a Church our city has never seen.
 
**SHARED VISION:**
Our vision really needs to be ligned up with God’s vision.
> Whatever your vision is in your live, it needs to be connected to a bigger purpose.
> Can u align to His vision and let go?
> When you take ownership of the vision, we can move forward. But its only possible when you know who you are.

**SEEING THE BIGGER PICTURE:**
We‘ve got to live our life focused and broad at the same time.
> Sometimes we are so focused that we are not aware of what is going on around us.
> Your story is important – but it is part of a bigger story and we need to be aware of that. Our story gets more significant!
 
**TAKING UP THE CHALLENGE OF LEADERSHIP:**
Biblical Leadership is placing value, pointing to vision and speaking to potential. We don’t place value on others, when we don’t know that we are valuable.
Give leadership to yourself, so that you can give leadership to others.

**COMMITMENT TO KEEP GROWING:**
Have you ever tried to lead someone who doesn’t want to grow. If you want to go somewhere, you need to keep growing.

**UNDERSTANDING THE POWER OF BEING A LONGHOLE PARTNER:**
Are you willing to say: If Jesus never does another thing for you  - it’s still ok. We have to make sure that we are “in” for the right reasons  - not to get something but because we got a revelation about what Jesus has done for us.

What are you going to do to establish your identity in Christ? Can you still dance when no one is looking? And when not everything is right?
