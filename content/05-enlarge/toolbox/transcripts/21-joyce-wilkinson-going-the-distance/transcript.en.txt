**KEY POINTS:**
God’s word brings light into the areas of our lives that are surrounded by darkness (Psalm 119:105)
If we are going to ‘go the distance’ our paths need to be well lit.
Because of Jesus in us we can deal with challenges (disappointment, disagreement, distraction) head on - we don’t need to ‘camp’ in the valley of the shadow of death (Psalm 23:4) but walk through it.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
**Psalm 119:105 NLT**
Your word is a lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path.
<br>
**Romans 5:1-2 NLT**
1 Therefore, since we have been made right in God’s sight by faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us. 2 Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God’s glory.
<br>
**Psalm 23:4 NLT**
Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me. Your rod and your staff protect and comfort me.
<br>
**John 16:33 NLT**
“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”
<br>

**Spirit, soul, body**
Spirit - this part of us is recreated in His image when we make Jesus the Lord of our lives
Soul - Mind (thinker), will (chooser), emotions (feeler)
→ All housed in a body
Our soul is where the battle is at on our journey. This area for you and I is in an ongoing process of changing and renewing till we enter eternity. There is a fight:
<br>
**1 Timothy 6:12**
Fight the good fight of faith.
It’s a ‘good fight’ because we overcome.
<br>
Three areas to highlight that will help us go the distance: Facts, feelings and faith
Faith doesn’t deny the facts (what happened) and how the facts make you feel but acknowledges that God is bigger.
A practical way to deal with challenges relating to the past can be to write down: 1. Facts: What happened 2. Feelings: How did/does that make you feel? 3. Faith - How does God’s word bring light into this situation?
<br>
**1 John 5:5 NKJV**
Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
<br>
**Freedom**
‘State of being free or at liberty, as opposed to being confined or under restraint.’ Paraphrase: Able to live without the baggage in life getting in our way and everyone else’s way. Dealing with the root with deal with the fruit.
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
All the wonderful attributes of the Spirit of God Himself, the Holy Spirit, now dwell in us: Love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control deposited in us in seed form at the new birth. Through life’s disappointments/disagreements/distractions we have the opportunity for these attributes to be developed in our lives.
Don’t let challenges stop you from all God has for you. Instead face challenges confidently and joyfully, knowing that God has equipped you with everything you need.
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
There are challenges from the past/in the present and in our future that need to be overcome but Jesus has overcome the greatest challenges – He conquered death, hell and the grave. Because He did so can we!
