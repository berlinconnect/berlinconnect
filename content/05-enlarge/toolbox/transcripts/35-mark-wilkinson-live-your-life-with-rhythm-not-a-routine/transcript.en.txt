**KEY POINTS: **
1. When Jesus is the centre, others are the focus. 
2. Christianity is only possible to live when there is a relationship with Jesus.
3. Jesus leads to more freedom, not less. This freedom is for us to lift up others.

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **
**Acts 2:42**
They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.

**“They devoted themselves”**
- Their relationship with Jesus caused them to devote themselves. 
- Devotion doesn’t mean extremism. 
- Devotion comes out of a relationship.
- Devotion is a fruit of knowing Jesus. 
- Devotion is adding value to other people. 
<br>
**Matthew 11:15, 28-30**
Are you listening to me? Really listening?
Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you’ll recover your life. I’ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me - watch how I do it. **Learn the unforced rhythms of grace**. I won’t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you’ll learn to live freely and lightly.
<br>
**Rhythm vs. Routine **
- Routine comes out of law. Rhythm comes out of grace.  
- Routine does not need an objective and goal. Rhythm always has an objective and goal. 
- Routine holds on. Rhythm lets go. 
- Routine is stingy. Rhythm is generous. 
- Routine creates smallness. Rhythm creates enlargement. 
- Routine limits you. Rhythm releases you. 
- Routine restricts growth. Rhythm creates growth.
- Routine is not friendly to diversity. Rhythm loves diversity. 
- Routine is married to pride. Rhythm is married to humility. 
- Routine takes you nowhere. Rhythm will take you somewhere.
- Routine tends not to be teachable. Rhythm is always teachable. 
- Routine needs rules. Rhythm loves breaking the rules. 
- Routine is rigid. Rhythm is flexible. 
- Routine is ‘you’-focused. Rhythm is ‘others’-focused. 
- Think Rhythm, not routine. 
- Think pattern , not perfection. 
- Think inside, not outside. 
- Think devotion, not duty. 
- Think ‘want to’, not ‘have to’. 
- Think generous, not stingy. 
- Think blessing, not curses. 
- Think grace, not law. 
- Think relationship, not religion. 
- Think big, not small.
- Think imagination, not fantasy. 
- Think test, not temptation.
- Think trust, not lust. 
- Think peace, not worry.

**When Jesus is centre, others are the focus.**
When you are the centre, you are the focus. 

**Legalism, Liberalism, and the Gospel**
Christianity is only possible to live when there is a relationship with Jesus. The Holy Spirit is very much needed in our Christian life. Otherwise, we will drift into legalism or liberalism. 

- Liberalism and legalism both end up narrowing our lives.
- The Gospel broadens the narrowness. 

Jesus leads to more freedom, not less. The difference lies in how you use your freedom: to lift up others. 

**It’s all about relationship**
Legalism wants God because He is useful in my life. Liberalism doesn’t want God because He gets in the way of personal Freedom. The Gospel wants God because of who He is. 

The Gospel connects you to Jesus. Jesus connects you to His church. And the church connects you to living out your God-given purpose. 
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
The Gospel teaches you the “unforced rhythms of grace”. Living with a rhythm comes out of the relationship between us and Jesus. 
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:** 
As a man thinks, so is he. What are you thinking? What are the most dominant thoughts you have?
