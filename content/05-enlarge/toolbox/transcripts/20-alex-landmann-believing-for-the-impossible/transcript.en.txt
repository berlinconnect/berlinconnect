**KEY POINTS:**
1. Having faith means trusting God to be bigger than your circumstances.
2. God creates out of nothing, He is not bound to our circumstances, He can always break through!
3. Don’t shrink your thinking to the possible, believe for the impossible.
4. Despite the facts, still believe.

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **
**Romans 4:16-24 NIV**
16 Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all. 17 As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed—the God who gives life to the dead and **calls into being things that were not. 18 Against all hope**, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” 19 Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was also dead. 20 Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, 21 being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. 22 This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”
<br>
**Faith - Genesis 11**
Having faith means trusting that God is bigger than your circumstances. When was the last time you prayed for the impossible?
Abraham was called the “Father of Faith”. When he was 70, he received the promise of God to become a great nation. God spoke to Abraham only 5 times in 25 years. Abraham had to make the decision to trust God to make His promise become a reality.
<br>
**God creates out of nothing**
God does not need anything to create something. If you feel like nothing, that’s exactly what God needs. He speaks things into being that are not with only one word. Abraham based his faith on this revelation. 
<br>
**Against all hope**
Abraham believed against all hope. He faced the facts of his old body, but nevertheless, he didn’t let his circumstances dictate his faith. True faith is not about ignoring the facts. But don’t allow reality to bring you down because of what you think is possible, but instead believe for the impossible. Despite the facts, still believe!
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
It doesn’t matter what your situation is, it doesn’t matter whether you feel hopeless - God is not bound to our emotions, He can always break through! 
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
Are you reducing your faith and your dreams to your reality? 
If Jesus asked you in person: “what do you want me to do?”, what would you say? Are you prepared for that question? What is your expectancy when it comes to God?
