**KEY POINTS:**
1. God elevates the hearts of those who walk through the process of faith
2. Be in the right position - identify the people you can trust in your vulnerable moments.
3. Choose to walk the 'worthy walk' in your life with God, not without.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
**MATTHEW 26:36-46 (NKJV)**
36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, “Sit here while I go and pray over there.” 37 And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed. 38 Then He said to them, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me.” 39 He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, “**O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.**”
<br>
- The word Gethsemane means oil press, where God removes anything that is not him, and the only thing that is left is purely Him.
- Jesus’ disciples were normal people with willing hearts, not the most theological people Jesus could find. God is using the normal people, like you and I.
<br>
This story is vital to our understanding of **the man** Jesus and it is a defining moment of His earthly ministry as He is about to die for our sins. In this moment, Jesus was with His disciples, people whom he could trust. We are not called to do this Christian journey alone, however we are to find people who will cause us to remember who we are and what our ultimate calling is. 
<br>
Jesus starts with all disciples and then walks further alone - from all of His disciples, to the select few until he is finally alone. He is going from community to complete intimacy with His Father. 
<br>
- Depending on our current season, we need to have the right people in the right position of our life. Identify the people you can trust. 

- When we are in struggle, we should take the worthy walk with God as he blesses the process, not just the results. This ‘Worthy Walk’ is also symbolic of the distance between relationship and religion, between internal condemnation and eternal salvation. With this walk, Jesus sealed our destiny - one with a future and a hope. It ended the law, and brought in grace. 
<br>
In this vulnerable moment we see Jesus’ humanity. Even Jesus agonised over His Father’s will for His life. Fully God and fully man, He asks for another way but He was the only one worthy to walk through this part of the process. Every day of His ministry He knew the destination and He knew, His life was for our development. Jesus did not live to show us up, but to show us how. Jesus walked a sinless life because he knew that we would not be able to.

He chose to walk the worthy walk in **obedience** to his calling, his earthly purpose. 
<br>
**Matthew 16:15 NIV**
15 “Who do you say I am?"

The confused responses of the disciples prove that just being with Jesus didn’t mean that they were the most theological of men, but they had humility enough to serve as they too had gone through a process. We often think Jesus breezes through life as a perfect person. He wasn’t hanging out with the spiritual elite but the everyman - his disciples. Jesus is not looking for the most theological minds but the most willing hearts
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
You are about to walk into a season of authority, power and prestige. God has invested in you, and wants you to give your best, He will take care of the rest. You have walked away from death, because Jesus walked the walk for you, just in case you want to get to know Him. How can we respond to this?
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
As you head into your week, think about ways you can live worthy of the price Jesus paid on the cross. What do you think is a worthy response to this act? Declare the life you live a life in relationship, remembrance and a life for serving others.
