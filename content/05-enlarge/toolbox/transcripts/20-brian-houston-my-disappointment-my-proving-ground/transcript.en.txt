**KEY POINTS:**
1. God has appointed you - connecting your life to the bigger purpose.
2. Don’t be discouraged if appointment is followed by disappointment.
3. God can use disappointment to grow your character.
4. Decide to live by appointment, not disappointment.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
<br>
**Romans 5:3-5 NKJV**
3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 **Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts **by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
<br>
**2 Timothy 1:8-11 NKJV**
8 Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but share with me in the sufferings for the gospel according to the power of God, 9 **who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose** and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began,10 but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, 11 to which I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
<br>
**Don’t let your appointment be affected by disappointment.**
We all face crushing disappointments. But disappointments do not come from God, God only appoints - He never disappointments. God has appointed you - connecting your life to the bigger purpose. Don’t be surprised if disappointments occur in times of God given appointments as the intention of disappointment is to take you off your appointed path. Don’t let disapointment dislodge you from your God given appointment. 
<br>
**Jeremiah 20:9 NKJV**
Then I said, “I will not make mention of Him,
Nor speak anymore in His name.”
**But His word was in my heart like a burning fire**
Shut up in my bones;
I was weary of holding it back,
And I could not.
<br>
**Live by appointment, not by disappointment.**
Whenever you step out and follow your appointment, disappointment often follows. Sometimes the first thing that happens. Are you going to be led by disappointment or by God given appointment? But when disappointment comes, don’t stop - the best is yet to come! Don’t let temporary disappointment rule your eternal appointment. What is in you is greater than what you are facing! God can use any disappointment to grow your character for your God given future. Don’t allow temporary things to build your life, only allow permanent things to build your life. Sometimes you will have to decide to put God first and rely on the fire that is burning within you instead of looking at the facts of the situation. Appointment has a time and it takes time - because perseverance builds character and perseverance takes time. The greater your character, the more can God pure into you.
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
Don’t let disappointment dislodge you from your God given appointment - always remember that God has appointed you! In times of disappointments, rely on the fire that is burning in your heart and put God first. Don’t forget that appointment has a time and takes time.
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
Are you facing disappointments? Remember that Jesus can build through disappointments. You have a hope that is bigger than any disappointment. Be encouraged to live a life of Godly appointment and allow your character to grow by disappointments.
