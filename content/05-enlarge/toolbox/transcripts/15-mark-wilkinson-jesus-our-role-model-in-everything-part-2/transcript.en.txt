**KEY POINTS:**
1. To be a good role model, you need to know a good role model. 
2. Adopt the mindset of Jesus. Jesus is the greatest role model of all!
3. We live in a world that desperately needs new role models. We are called to be role models for the next generation. We are called to stand out in society, not to blend in.

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **
**Philippians 2:2-11 NLT**
2 If you find any comfort from being united with Christ, if His love brings you any encouragement, if you experience true companionship with the Spirit, if His tenderness and mercy fill your heart; then, brothers and sisters, 2 here is one thing that would complete my joy - **come together as one in mind and spirit and purpose, sharing in the same love**. 3 Don’t let selfishness and **prideful** agendas take over. Embrace true **humility**, and lift your heads to extend love to others. 4 Get beyond yourselves and protecting your own interests; be sincere, and secure your neighbors’ interests first. 5 **In other words, when it comes to relationships with each other, adopt the mind-set of Jesus. Live with His attitude in your hearts. Remember:** 6 Though He was the **exact likeness** of God, He chose not to cling to equality with God; 7 But He poured Himself out to fill a vessel brand new; a servant in form and a man indeed. The very likeness of humanity, 8 He **humbled** Himself, obedient to death—a merciless death on the cross! 9 So God raised Him up to the highest place and gave Him the name above all. 10 So when His name is called, every knee will bow, in heaven, on earth, and below. 11 And every tongue will confess “Jesus, the Anointed One, is Lord,”  to the glory of God our Father!

**To be a good role model, you need to know a good role model**
Is your role model subject to failure? Human role models are always subject to failure, but Jesus is not. Jesus is the greatest role model of all. If you want to be a good role model, then you need to know a good role model. Jesus humbled himself - even to the point of death. He positioned Himself as a servant. To represent Jesus as our role model, we need to get to know him.

**The example of Jesus **
-) Entitlement vs. servanthood 
       -Entitlement means “you owe me”. God doesn’t owe you anything. 
       -Do you use your freedom to serve yourself or to serve other people? 
       -True servanthood comes from knowing who you are (right identity)
-) Self-Focus vs. the cause of Christ
-) Independence vs. submission
       -Adopt the mindset of Jesus when it comes to relationships. 
-) Mediocrity vs. excellence
       -We don’t serve a mediocre God, we serve an excellent God. 
-) Selfishness vs. generosity
       -Generosity means ‘no strings attached’.

**CONCLUSION:**
In life people don’t really rise to the occasion, but they always fall back to what’s in their heart or fall back to default. That’s why we need a saviour called Jesus. By following Him we can live a life of servanthood. This helps us to be an example that others can follow. It’s not about being perfect, it’s about serving a perfect God.
