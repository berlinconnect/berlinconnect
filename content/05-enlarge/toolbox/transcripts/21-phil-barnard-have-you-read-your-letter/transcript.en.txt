**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

**Philemon 1 NIV**
1 This letter is from Paul, a prisoner for preaching the Good News about Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy. I am writing to Philemon, our beloved co-worker, 2 and to our sister Apphia, and to our fellow soldier Archippus, and to the church that meets in your house. 3 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. 4 I always thank my God when I pray for you, Philemon, 5 because I keep hearing about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all of God’s people. 6 And I am praying that you will put into action the generosity that comes from your faith as you understand and experience all the good things we have in Christ. 7 Your love has given me much joy and comfort, my brother, for your kindness has often refreshed the hearts of God’s people.
8 That is why I am boldly asking a favor of you. I could demand it in the name of Christ because it is the right thing for you to do. 9 But because of our love, I prefer simply to ask you. Consider this as a request from me—Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus. 10 **I appeal to you to show kindness to my child, Onesimus**. I became his father in the faith while here in prison. 11 Onesimus hasn’t been of much use to you in the past, but now he is very useful to both of us. 12 **I am sending him back to you, and with him comes my own heart**. 13 I wanted to keep him here with me while I am in these chains for preaching the Good News, and he would have helped me on your behalf. 14 But I didn’t want to do anything without your consent. I wanted you to help because you were willing, not because you were forced. 15 It seems you lost Onesimus for a little while so that you could have him back forever. 16 **He is no longer like a slave to you. He is more than a slave, for he is a beloved brother, especially to me. Now he will mean much more to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.**
17 So if you consider me your partner, **welcome him as you would welcome me**. 18 **If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to me**. 19 I, PAUL, WRITE THIS WITH MY OWN HAND: I WILL REPAY IT. AND I WON’T MENTION THAT YOU OWE ME YOUR VERY SOUL! 20 Yes, my brother, please do me this favor for the Lord’s sake. Give me this encouragement in Christ. 21 I am confident as I write this letter that you will do what I ask and even more! 22 One more thing—please prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that God will answer your prayers and let me return to you soon. 23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings. 24 So do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my co-workers. 25 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

**Paul reaches out to Philemon on behalf of Onesimus **
Paul offers to stand in on behalf of Onesimus debt so Onesimus can be reconciled and be welcomed home into God’s kingdom. Paul was interested in Philemon’s heart and for him to see his friend Onesimus no longer as a slave but as a brother. 
Because Jesus has paid all the debt for Paul, Paul wants to do the same for others, including a run-away slave like Onesimus. On Easter, Jesus reached out to God the Father and reached out to us - thus reconciling us with God. There is nothing you can do to earn His favour, nothing you can do to pay your own debt. Instead someone has already done it for you - Jesus!

**Read your letter**
Sometimes we run away from things in our life and sometimes we run away from God. But we all have the opportunity to come back to God. Realise that just like Paul stood in on behalf of Onesimus, Jesus has stood up for you. He has paid all of our debt and prepared a letter for us. Once you read your letter and accept what Jesus has done for you, you are not a slave - you now are a part of the family. You are no longer a run-away, you are reconciled. You are no longer useless, you are useful in God’s kingdom.
<br>
**God redeems us so we can be messengers**
You are a messenger. Reading our letter enables us to come just as boldly before the Father as Jesus. It also helps us approach people the way Paul approached Onesimus, with love, humility and forgiveness. 
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
The story of Paul, Onesimus and Philemon points towards what Jesus has done for us - He has stood in on our behalf. Because of Him and by placing our faith in Him we have the same standing before the Father that Jesus has before Him.

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
Are you running away from people or circumstances that have hurt you or taken something from you? Stop looking at them and what they did to you. Instead focus on Jesus who has paid all your debt and freed you from your sin - so you can now go and show His love and forgiveness to others.
