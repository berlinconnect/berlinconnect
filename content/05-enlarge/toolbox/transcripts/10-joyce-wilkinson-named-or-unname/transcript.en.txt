KEY POINTS:

1. Being part of a standout generation, is not based on gifts and talents. 
2. It is not exclusive, it is inclusive. It is not based on gifts and talents, but on grace and humility. What little we have, we put it in the hand of our Saviour. 
3. A stand out generation doesn’t care if our name is known or unknown. The only name we want to lift up and glorify, is the name of Jesus. When we lift him up, and make him bigger than everything else, he works with that and draws people to Him.

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **

**John 6:7-13 NIV **
7 Philip answered him, “It would take more than half a year’s wages to buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!” 8 Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up, 9 “Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many? 10 Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” There was plenty of grass in that place, and they sat down (about five thousand men were there). 11 Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated **as much as they wanted**. He did the same with the fish. 12 When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.” 13 So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.

**This unknown boy exemplifies the qualities of a stand out generation**
History is full of standout people, some are named, but many are unnamed. In a stand out generation, we are called to act regardless of our name being known or not. This little boy (who in three gospels of the Bible isn’t even mentioned) is a perfect example of this. Jesus was able to feed all these people because of his small offering. He looked to Jesus and therefore, he was wise with who he was giving what little he had to. 
<br>
**Matthew 16:13-20 NIV**
13 When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?” 14 They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” 15 “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?” 16 Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” 17 Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. 18 And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” 20 Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
<br>
**Who do you say Jesus is?** 
He is going to build his church on the revelation that Jesus Christ is the living Son of God. 
It’s not the building, it’s the **you and I**, and when we have this revelation, we can not help but stand out. We live completely different; we live based on the revelation that the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead now lives within us and because of this, we **carry the presence of God** which is confident, serving, generous, joyful, and full of love. This is in our DNA, as we are built on Him. 
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
Remember that moment of your salvation. It was from this moment, the Holy Spirit resided in you. Being connected to Jesus makes us a standout generation, called to make a difference in the world around us. We have a revelation of who we are, who we are living for, and why we are here. Whether we are ‘named or unnamed’ we are here to draw lost people home and make disciples out of them, which isn’t done through talents, but knowing who are are in Christ.

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:** 
As you go through your week, whether it is a work meeting, a coffee date, or a hangout with family and friends, let us not forget that everyone we meet gets to encounter the presence of God.
