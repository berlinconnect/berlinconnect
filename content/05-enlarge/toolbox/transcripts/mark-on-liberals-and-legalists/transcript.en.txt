Text: Luke 15
 
Jesus was talking to two groups of people: the liberals (who made up their own rules) and the legalists (who tried to keep the rules). Today, we still belong to one of the groups, or sometimes both.
 
Acts 2:42
 
God was able to add to the church daily. He wants to add to the local church and He is using us to bring sons and daughters home. In order to bring people home, you need to know that you are part of the family; that you are a son or a daughter loved by Jesus. And when you have been reconciled with Christ, you are called to share your story with others who don’t know Him yet.
 
In Acts 2, people joined the church because they liked what they saw. They saw generous, authentic and attractive RELATIONSHIPS. What they saw was a common PURPOSE.
 
When you connect to Christ and you are good with Him, it has the power to change all the relationships in your life.
 
You can believe, and not belong; and you can belong, and not believe.
 
Often, people connect to the local church before they connect to Jesus. Anybody is welcome in God’s house, no matter if they are not connected to Christ, if they are sceptical or simply just don’t believe. It is not our job to convince them, but to make Jesus visible through our story.

In our city, it is easy to put relationships, career or riches in the center of your life. But we as the church should work on bringing lost sons and daughters home in the center of our lives.
 
If you work out your Christ connection, your purpose connection, your personal relationships and all the other relationships in your life will be powerfully influenced. Jesus wants to connect with you. How is your Christ connection?
