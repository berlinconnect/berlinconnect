**KEY POINTS: **
1. Commit to right associations in life - who you do life with affects you and your growth.
2. Sharing your faith in your everyday life is easy and meaningful.
3. Learn to ask the right questions in life – the WHY question answers the WHAT and the HOW question.

<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **

**Proverbs 13:20 MSG**
Become wise by walking with the wise;
hang out with fools and watch your life fall to pieces.

**Proverbs 13:20 CEV**
Wise friends make you wise,
but you hurt yourself by going around with fools.
<br>

**Associations in Life**

**Relationship with Jesus**
We can have a friendship with a living saviour, not a dead hero.
There are things in your future that you will never know until you get into an intimate relationship with the living saviour. The key to knowing the intimacy of heaven is through knowing Jesus. 
Bearing fruit and becoming more like him is a byproduct of that relationship. The fruit appears naturally because of what it’s connected to. Don’t go for the fruit, go for the relationship.
<br>
**Relationships with People**
Association with the wise helps impact your life. If you want to be wise, hang around wise people. If you want to grow and enlarge, who you do life with will affect you. There is no neutrality in the kingdom of God. You either move forward or backward. 
Who is it you’re doing life with that will help you get better and bigger?
Be committed to your own growth. Learn to ask questions. Don’t let pride hold you back. Sometimes you moving forward is just a simple conversation away. You’ve got to grow you to help others grow. Who can you learn from and who can teach you something?
 <br>
**Three groups of people you need in life:**
- People further down the road.
- People alongside you (peers).
- People you’re taking by the hand.
Question to ask yourself: Is your example in life worth following?
<br>
**Church & Career**
No matter what your career, we're all called to serve Christ in whatever sphere of life we find ourselves. 
“I'm building a career so I can build church. I'm building church so my career can be built.” 
Are you going on holidays to come back and work or working to go on holidays? 
Connect church to work. Church can release you into all you’re called to be.

<br>
**CONCLUSIONS**

**Three things that will help you in life:**
1. Stay around Jesus.
2. Stay around His church. It is a place that points you to Jesus.
3. Make wise choices about who you do life with.

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
Are you committed to your own growth and to right associations?
