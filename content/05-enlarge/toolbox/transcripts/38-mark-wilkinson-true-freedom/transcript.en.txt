**KEY POINTS: **
1. Sin = Building your identity on anything other than God. 
2. Humility = I know who I am because I know who He is. Humility is right identity.
3. Jesus takes our sin and positions us in freedom. He gives us a new identity. And in this freedom, there is room to make mistakes, to grow, to succeed. 
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **
**Colossians 2:13-23 NLT**
You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away. Then God made you alive with Christ, **for he forgave all our sins. 14 He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross.** 15 In this way, he disarmed the spiritual rulers and authorities. He shamed them publicly by his victory over them on the cross.
16 So don’t let anyone condemn you for what you eat or drink, or for not celebrating certain holy days or new moon ceremonies or Sabbaths. 17 For these rules are only shadows of the reality yet to come. And Christ himself is that reality. 18 Don’t let anyone condemn you by insisting on pious self-denial or the worship of angels, saying they have had visions about these things. **Their sinful minds have made them proud, 19 and they are not connected to Christ, the head of the body.** For he holds the whole body together with its joints and ligaments, and it grows as God nourishes it.
20 You have died with Christ, and he has set you free from the spiritual powers of this world. So why do you keep on following the rules of the world, such as, 21 “Don’t handle! Don’t taste! Don’t touch!”? 22 Such rules are mere human teachings about things that deteriorate as we use them. 23 These rules may seem wise because they require strong devotion, pious self-denial, and severe bodily discipline. But they provide no help in conquering a person’s evil desires.

**Legalism vs. Liberalism **
The mentality behind legalism is to use God to get what you want, the one behind liberalism is seeing God as a hindrance to your personal freedom.
Are we using God because He is useful or are we in a relationship with Him because He is beautiful?
Liberalism parades sin and calls it freedom. 
Legalism tries to hide sin. 
Jesus takes our sin upon Himself.  
<br>
**Humility vs. Pride**
God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Stubbornness, pride, proving yourself comes out of wrong identity and hurts relationships. 
Humility comes out of right identity. It doesn’t feel the need to compare and condemn and is, therefore, the answer to all relationship.
Humility = I know who I am because I know who He is.  
<br>
**CONCLUSIONS: **
**The Gospel**
The Gospel = Jesus takes our sin and positions us in freedom. He gives us a new identity. And in this freedom, there is room to make mistakes, to grow, to succeed. 
The Gospel makes His grace bigger, not our sin. 
Liberalism and legalism suffocate you because it makes everything about yourself. Only in the Gospel, real progress is possible.

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
What are you building your identity on? Both liberalism and legalism end up narrowing our lives - only the Gospel offers true freedom in Christ.
