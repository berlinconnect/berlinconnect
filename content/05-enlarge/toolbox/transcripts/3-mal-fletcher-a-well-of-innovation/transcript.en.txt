KEY POINTS:
1. The church is built to influence the environment in which we are placed to ultimately build His Kingdom on earth.
2. God constantly opens doors of opportunities for us to benefit His Kingdom. We are here in this specific time and place for a reason.
3. God calls us to be leaders of innovation.
  <br>
KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:
 <br>
Romans 12:2 (NIV)
2 Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the **renewing of your mind**. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is - His good, pleasing, and perfect will.
 <br>
- **We can not conform** to the world around us, instead we need to remember we are not of the world, but rather of Him and that we have been placed in this environment and in this time, for a specific reason. For this reason,
- **God has called us to influence and lead in the environment we are in**, and we can better do so by renewing our mind daily, to follow Him and His ways.
- **We need to constantly renew our mind** and draw closer to Jesus. In doing so, we are also generating new ideas of how we can impact the people around us, His people.
- **God calls us to be leaders of innovation** - like Joseph. Joseph set up the first international feeding program and saved the world from a devastating, international drought. As a result, he saved people, and greatly impacted the society around him. Just like Joseph, God has called us to be leading the way when it comes to innovation.
 <br>
Genesis 26:14-15 (NIV)
14 He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him. 15 So all the **wells** that his father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, **filling them with earth**. 16 Then Abimelek said to Isaac, “Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us.” 17 So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled.
 <br>
- **Filling them with earth** - in this context, symbolizes replacing our own
 personal well from which Jesus flows with earthly things, that which are
 not of God.
- **The church is built for influence**. In Isaac’s time whoever controlled the water wells had influence, as water was a necessity. This verse show’s Isaac taking back his well, and therefore his influence God intended for him to have.
- **Nobody can take your influence away** from you unless you allow it. Our influence is God given and it is our rightful inheritance.
- **The local church has influence on society** and is a fundamental building block to the Kingdom of God, which is a kingdom where all goodness is able be drawn - as from a well- from Him alone.
  <br>
**CONCLUSION:**
Because we are here at this specific time, we have a specific will and calling in our lives. As Christians, we are called to lead those around us to a closer relationship with God in all spheres of our lives. He therefore has asked us to renew our mind - by learning, growing and being inspired to come up with new innovated ideas that can impact our society and ultimately give glory to God.

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
Because of Berlin’s history, the wells of innovation and opportunity which Jesus planted have been earthed over. Now, there is a shift happening, one where these wells are bubbling with ripe opportunity to burst and impact society. These opportunities are literally under our feet. Are you seizing the opportunities around you - big and small - to impact your different environments?
