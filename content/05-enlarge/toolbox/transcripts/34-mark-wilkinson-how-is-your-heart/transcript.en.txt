Text: - There are seminars about financial management and on how to do relationships well but the real issue is: “How do you manage your heart?”
- Your heart determines the quality of your life. Whatever has your heart has got your life.
- That’s why there is a battle for your heart, because there has always been a battle for your life. The battle for you started at conception.
- Where there is no heart connection you will always need laws, rules, contracts, policies and written agreements.
- What connects God’s to us? Love - from His heart. What connects us to God? Love - our heart for Him. What connects us to each other? Love - a loving heart.
- Heart connection can only work with love and in an atmosphere of love.
- You need God to walk in love with Him and with each other.
- The greatest command is to love the Lord with all your heart, mind and strength and to love your neighbour as you love yourself. Only Jesus has done this - that’s why we need Him.

**Matthew 12:33 NLT**
“A tree is identified by its fruit. If a tree is HEALTHY, its fruit will be HEALTHY. If a tree is CORRUPT, its fruit will be CORRUPT.

**Matthew 12:34b NLV**
…The mouth speaks what the HEART is full of…

**Luke 6:45b NKLV**
...out of the abundance of the HEART the mouth speaks…

**Matthew 12:34b MSG**
It’s your HEART, not the dictionary, that gives meaning to your words.

**Proverbs 4:23 NCV**
Be careful what you THINK, because your thoughts run your life.

Thoughts → imagination → argument → stronghold
Take hold of every thought (2 Corinthians 10:5)

**Proverbs 4:23 NLT**
Guard your HEART above all else, for it determines the course of your life.
Guard your HEART because it affects everything you do

**John 15:5 NLV**
I am the TRUE Vine and you are the branches. Get your life from Me.
Then I will live in you and you will give much fruit. You can do nothing without Me.
