Text: Ephesians 2:13 NLT

The verse is very relevant to the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall and very relevant to us. Walls are built to represent division, lack of opportunity, obstacles and limitation.

What type of walls are you (still) building in your lives? 

Often we create walls in our minds that are holding us back to reach what God wants to do with us. It might be a wall of fear, ignorance or self-consciousness. We tend to build walls instead of breaking them down.

The Berlin wall didn’t came down in one go. It took a lot of effort from different people and quite some time. Most of the time we think that we cannot do it because walls cannot come down in one go. But we need to start with little things to break down our walls. The best thing you can do for yourself is starting to do something outside of your comfort zone. If you want to live a full life you need to be out of your comfort zone!

Romans 12

There are three key things to tear down walls:

**1. Knowledge: Renew your mind**
Keep renewing your mind by learning new things. By changing your mindsets we can move on and tear down walls in our minds. Aquire new knowledge and stretch yourself! 

**2. Skill: Use your gifts**
We need to practice our abilities and what we have been given to increase our skill levels. Serving in church is actually a great way to do so.

**3. Attitude: Be humble **
It’s not enough to be the best in something when you are not humble and don't think of yourself as a servant. When times are difficult, our real attitude shows up. Check your attitude!

Let’s apply these principles and bring down some walls in our lives! Let’s also be the kind of people that can open the doors for others and lead people through it. 

Know for yourself that God is on your side and put you in this world for a bigger purpose.
Don’t listen to the voices that want you to build walls in your mind.
Break them. Tear them down. Believe in the power of God!
