Text: Hillsong and Colour Conferences are annual gatherings that unite people from every walk of life and church background.  An environment that places value, speaks to potential and points to Godly vision.

###Hillsong Conference
Hillsong Conference is about ‘Championing the cause of the local Church’. You will be inspired, refreshed and energised to live out your God-given purpose and will find great strength and unity amongst the diversity of the local Church worldwide.

###Colour Conference
Colour Conference is much more than a conference.  It is a gathering, strengthening, sharpening, equipping and mobilising of thousands of women around the world.  It is a stand for justice and the mobilisation of women, who have experienced the incredible grace and love of a wonderful Saviour.
