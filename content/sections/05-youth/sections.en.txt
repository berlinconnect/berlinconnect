Title: Youth

Intro: Becoming resilient citizens for the future.

Text: We purposefully place value on the youth of our city.  By expressing God’s message in a relevant way we want to equip our 12 to 18 year olds to become resilient urban citizens for the future.
Through diverse forums and get-togethers we aim to create an environment of trust and friendship that supports and inspires young people, to be positive and hopeful about life and the dreams they have. Friday nights and Sundays are a big deal.
