Text: Our desire is that Sundays in God’s House will be a place where people from all walks of life can come and feel 'AT HOME'. A place of connection with God and each other, of encouragement and worship, a place where guests become family.

Our services are @10:30 12:30 16:30 & 18:30 every Sunday.  They include live music, kids & youth activities for 1-16 year olds and translation in German, Spanish and Portuguese.
