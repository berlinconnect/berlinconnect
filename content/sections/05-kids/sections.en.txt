Intro: Preparing the next generation.

Text: Our desire at Berlin Connect is to create a safe, fun-filled environment that children love coming to. The Next Generation Team are passionate about expressing the message of Jesus in a creative, relevant way.  We pray that your children will encounter Jesus as their Lord and Saviour and grow up knowing who they are in Christ.

We truly believe that children are a gift from the Lord (Psalm 127:3) and count it an honour to play our part in raising champions.
