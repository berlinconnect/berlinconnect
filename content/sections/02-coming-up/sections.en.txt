Intro: This Sunday, Guest Speakers & more.

Text: Church is not what you think it is.....it's *more than* what you think it is.  Every Sunday you will be encouraged with spiritual 'food' and Godly wisdom that will equip and strengthen you for life.

There are various speakers including our Pastors Mark & Joyce Wilkinson, the Berlin Connect team, as well as guest speakers from all over the world.
