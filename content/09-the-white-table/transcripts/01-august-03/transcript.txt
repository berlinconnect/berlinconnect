We’re all on mission from God in this city.  It is important to prepare our mindset for that. (Romans 12,2)

Truths about being on mission:

1) We all have a mission; God has a plan and a purpose for each single life in His church; there is not a single life He does not have a plan for (Rev. 22:17)
2) All Mission starts simple and small; Jesus’ first miracle was turning water into wine; with the second and third he was healing people; the first involvement of the disciples in miracles was in the fourth miracle when they were serving people food and collecting the scraps afterwards; the fifth miracle was Jesus walking on the water; so in the beginning, the disciples were only doing simple and humble tasks and only witnessing the grand ones; just like this, mission starts with simple first steps before we can take on more responsibility
3) Our mission is irrevocable (Romans 11:29); God’s mission for the world and our role in it will not stop or cease just because we doubt, or because we get involved less, or we drift off; Jesus will go after us if we drift off and the mission will perservere

Mindsets we need to break:

1) Qualification mindset: thinking that our qualifications are not enough to serve the Lord;

a. Ex. 3:11: Moses gets direct orders from God: he responds by saying: who am I do carry out your tasks? Why me? He reacts by questioning his qualifications
b. Judges 6:15: Gideon reacts to orders from God by questioning his qualifications; he focuses on his weakness that would disqualify him from serving the Lord
c. Eph 2:4-10: Not your works or your goodness, but the faith of God save you

God does not want your ability; He wants your availability; it is not about your qualifications, but about His grace; if your good works cannot qualify you, then your weaknesses cannot disqualify you.

2) Popular opinion mindset: my acceptance by others, the popular opinion will determine my ability to serve the Lord and to preach to others; if nobody listens to me, how can I preach the Gospel?

a. Ex. 4:1: Moses worries about that people will not believe that he met God
b. Judges 7:3: God tells Gideon that he has too many soldiers, because He wants the victory to be a miracle; popular opinion was that sending away troops was madness
c. Mark 10:46-52When the blind man wanted to be healed by Jesus, his helpers asked him to be quiet; but he cried out for Him anyways and got healed

Popular opinion wants to keep your where you are; but God operates on a higher level and wants to use you regardless of popular opinion; His blessing is already on you.

3)   Participation mindset: it will happen with or without me; why cannot someone else do it? God does not need me to get involved

a.     Ex. 4:13;14-17: Moses wants God to get someone else to do what He wants Moses to do

God wants us; no one can take our place in His plan; otherwise the people He wants to reach will not get reached

4)   Historical performance mindset: I have messed up too many times to be useful for Him

a.     Ex.: Moses ran away into the desert for forty years because he had committed murder and carried that burden with him; still God chose him and no one else

Your past actions do not determine the future that God has for you.
