Title: My Heart For The House

----

Introheading: This Is What Our Heart Beats For

----

Introcopy: We want to change people’s perceptions about Jesus and His Church. Church is not a building or an institution, but a family, a ‘house’ made up of people from all walks of life. God’s House is a community that is always open for more people of all ages to ‘take their place at the table’, to ‘come home’ and to discover who they are by discovering who He is.

Our annual Heart for the House offering is a practical way of seeing this mission become a reality through our collective giving on 05 October and beyond for those who want to contribute through an ongoing monthly & annual commitment over and above tithes and offerings. By resourcing God’s House we are resourcing people, including the generations to come.

Kingdomgivercopy: BRING A GIFT ON THE DAY & A YEARLY COMMITMENT

Kingdom givers is a new initiative starting this year that will create an opportunity for people to develop as financial leaders in God’s House. This new initiative will enable us to invest and develop people who believe God has called them to finance the work of Jesus by using their gifts, talents and character to add value and strength to build God’s House. Kingdom givers will be a vehicle to help people who want to develop as business leaders, entrepreneurs and marketplace leaders.

We are very excited about this new initiative and its potential to release people into the fullness of God's purposes on their lives. Kingdom givers is by application and is an annual commitment to resourcing the ongoing work of Berlin Connect.

If you have a desire to be a financial leader in building God's House as a Kingdom giver please contact David for an application form on (email: dberndt@berlinclc.de text: dberndt@berlinclc.de).
