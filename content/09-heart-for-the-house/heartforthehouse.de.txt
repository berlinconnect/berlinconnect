Title: My Heart For The House
----

IntroHeading: This Is What Our Heart Beats For
----

IntroCopy: We want to change people’s perceptions about Jesus and His Church. Church is not a building or an institution, but a family, a ‘house’ made up of people from all walks of life. God’s House is a community that is always open for more people of all ages to ‘take their place at the table’, to ‘come home’ and to discover who they are by discovering who He is.

Our annual Heart for the House offering is a practical way of seeing this mission become a reality through our collective giving on 05 October and beyond for those who want to contribute through an ongoing monthly & annual commitment over and above tithes and offerings. By resourcing God’s House we are resourcing people, including the generations to come.
