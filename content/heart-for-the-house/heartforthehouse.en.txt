ANY AMOUNT ON THE DAY

1 Chronicles 29 MSG
Dear Lord, who am I, and who are these my people, that we should presume to be giving something to you? Everything comes from you; all we’re doing is giving back what we’ve been given from your generous hand..... so I have given from the heart, honestly and happily...

Berlin Connect has always been blessed with faithful givers who are willing and generous in their outlook on life and understand that our contribution large or small will always give God an opportunity to show His faithfulness in our lives.

BRING A GIFT ON THE DAY & A YEARLY COMMITMENT

Kingdom givers is an initiative that creates an opportunity for people to develop as financial leaders in God’s House. This new initiative will enable us to invest and develop people who believe God has called them to finance the work of Jesus by using their gifts, talents and character to add value and strength to build God’s House. Kingdom givers will be a vehicle to help people who want to develop as business leaders, entrepreneurs and marketplace leaders.

We are very excited about this new initiative and its potential to release people into the fullness of God's purposes on their lives. Kingdom givers is by application and is an annual commitment to resourcing the ongoing work of Berlin Connect.

If you have a desire to be a financial leader in building God's House as a Kingdom giver please contact David for an application form on (email: dberndt@berlinclc.de text: dberndt@berlinclc.de).
